# Incorrect calculation of executionFee for keepers

## Summary
The gas calculated as the executionFee  is wrongly calculated.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently the `startingGas` is calculated from the handlers themselves and then it is forwarded to the utils libraries, which later is payed calling gasUtils `payExecutionFee`

The issue is that `startingGas` started being accounted from the handler: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/DepositHandler.sol#L64

despite having already burned gas from the previous call in the router contract:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/router/ExchangeRouter.sol#L122-L132

As seen in the snippet those 10 lines of code are not accounted for the `executionFee ` and all of them convert to opcodes that cost gas.

I believe that it was like this to not calculate the 1/64 gas nor forwarded in the first external call, however, it does not mean that there is a miss-calculation that causes less refund for the keepers.

## Impact
Not enough refund for keepers

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate the startingGas from the exchangeRouter and pass the parameter to WithdrawalHandler. Once you get to the calculation in gasUtils, you can substract the 1/64 that was not forwarded.

```solidity
   function cancelDeposit(bytes32 key) external payable nonReentrant {

       uint256 startingGas = gasleft();   //here
        Deposit.Props memory deposit = DepositStoreUtils.get(dataStore, key);
        if (deposit.account() == address(0)) {
            revert Errors.EmptyDeposit();
        }

        if (deposit.account() != msg.sender) {
            revert Errors.Unauthorized(msg.sender, "account for cancelDeposit");
        }

        depositHandler.cancelDeposit(key, startingGas ); //PASS IT
    }
```


```solidity
    function payExecutionFee(
        DataStore dataStore,
        EventEmitter eventEmitter,
        StrictBank bank,
        uint256 executionFee,
        uint256 startingGas,
        address keeper,
        address user
    ) external {
        uint256 gasUsed = (startingGas * 63/64) - gasleft();  //ADD
```
