# Overflow protection in `getNextOpenInterestParams()` makes overflow more likely

## Summary

Overflow protection in `getNextOpenInterestParams()` makes overflow more likely, rather than less likely


## Vulnerability Detail

The comments in `getNextOpenInterestForVirtualInventory()` say, `the virtual long and short open interest is adjusted by the usdDelta to prevent an overflow in getNextOpenInterestParams`. Looking at `getNextOpenInterestParams()` the only possible overflows related to addition are these calls: `Calc.sumReturnUint256(X, params.usdDelta);`

Looking back at the adjustment being made, `X` is being added to, so the only thing the protection appears to be doing is making the overflow _more_ likely, not less:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/pricing/PositionPricingUtils.sol : PositionPricingUtils.getNextOpenInterestForVirtualInventory()   #1

322            // the virtual long and short open interest is adjusted by the usdDelta
323            // to prevent an overflow in getNextOpenInterestParams
324            // price impact depends on the change in USD balance, so offsetting both
325            // values equally should not change the price impact calculation
326            if (params.usdDelta < 0) {
327 @>             uint256 offset = (-params.usdDelta).toUint256();
328                longOpenInterest += offset;
329                shortOpenInterest += offset;
330            }
331    
332            return getNextOpenInterestParams(params, longOpenInterest, shortOpenInterest);
333:       }

## Impact

Open interest for virtual inventory will revert sooner than expected, preventing users from doing swaps, which will lead to orders being frozen, or liquidations being blocked due to reverts.

## Recommendation

Subtract rather than add the offset
