# No check for account validation

## Summary
No check for account validation in` executeDeposit()` which can lead to loss of deposit.

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `executeDeposit()` in ExecuteDepositUtils.sol has a check for empty deposits, i.e address(0), but it does not have any check for account validation with `AccountUtils.validateAccount(account)`. 
Function `executeDeposit()` takes `ExecuteDepositParams `which takes  `address account ` as input but it does not have validate account check.

## Impact
All the important states of contract has account validations in place as in [for createOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/OrderUtils.sol#L54).
Here `executeDeposit()` in ExecuteDepositUtils.sol it is absent, so, it may result in loss of credibility of accounts.
