# MarketUtils.validateMarketTokenBalance() does not validate the token balance properly, as a result, the min balance might not be satisfied.

## Summary
``MarketUtils.validateMarketTokenBalance()`` does not validate the token balance properly, as a result, the min balance might not be satisfied.

## Vulnerability Detail
When funds move out of the market, one task is to check the minimum balance of the token is still satisfied by function ``MarketUtils.validateMarketTokenBalance()``. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L2331-L2354](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L2331-L2354)

However, the check is performed separately for ``claimableFundingFeeAmount``. This is a problem, just because ``balance >= expectedMinBalance`` and `` balance >= claimableFundingFeeAmount``, does not mean the balance can cover both. Suppose right after the check, a user claim some funding, then it might become possible that now ``balance < expectedMinBalance``, a violation.

One should check and make sure ``balance >= expectedMinBalance + claimableFundingFeeAmount`` instead to make sure the balance can cover both.



## Impact
MarketUtils.validateMarketTokenBalance() does not validate the token balance properly, as a result, the min balance might not be satisfied.
