# IncreaseOrderUtils#validateOracleBlockNumbers() does not validate the oracle block numbers used for the prices in the oracle for LimitIncrease orders.

## Summary
``IncreaseOrderUtils#validateOracleBlockNumbers()`` does not validate the oracle block numbers used for the prices in the oracle for LimitIncrease orders. As a result, obsolete oracle might be used. 

## Vulnerability Detail

``IncreaseOrderUtils#validateOracleBlockNumbers()`` is used to validate the oracle block numbers used for the prices in the oracle. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/IncreaseOrderUtils.sol#L81-L111](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/IncreaseOrderUtils.sol#L81-L111)

However, for limit increase orders, it fails to check   ``maxOracleBlockNumbers`` against `` orderUpdatedAtBlock``.

```javascript
if (orderType == Order.OrderType.LimitIncrease) {
            // since the oracle blocks are only validated against the orderUpdatedAtBlock
            // it is possible to cause a limit increase order to become executable by
            // having the order have an initial collateral amount of zero then opening
            // a position and depositing collateral if the limit order is desired to be executed
            // for this case, when the limit order price is reached, the order should be frozen
            // the frozen order keepers should only execute frozen orders if the latest prices
            // fulfill the limit price
            if (!minOracleBlockNumbers.areGreaterThanOrEqualTo(orderUpdatedAtBlock)) {
                revert Errors.OracleBlockNumbersAreSmallerThanRequired(minOracleBlockNumbers, orderUpdatedAtBlock);
            }
            return;
        }
```

This means, an obsolete price might used for the trade. 

## Impact
IncreaseOrderUtils#validateOracleBlockNumbers() does not validate the oracle block numbers used for the prices in the oracle for LimitIncrease orders. As a result, an obsolete oracle price might be used for the trade.
