# MarketFactory Contract Duplicate Market Creation Vulnerability

## Summary
At [LINE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketFactory.sol#L46)

The following bug bounty report outlines a vulnerability discovered in the `MarketFactory` contract. The vulnerability allows for unauthorized creation of duplicate markets, leading to potential inconsistency and misuse of resources.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the `createMarket` function of the `MarketFactory` contract. Specifically, the function fails to adequately check for existing markets before creating a new one. This allows an attacker to repeatedly create markets with the same parameters, resulting in duplicated market instances.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability includes potential confusion and inefficiency within the system. Duplicate markets can lead to misallocation of resources, as well as inconsistencies in market data and operations. Additionally, the redundant markets could confuse users and hinder the proper functioning of the system.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function createMarket(
    address indexToken,
    address longToken,
    address shortToken,
    bytes32 marketType
) external onlyMarketKeeper returns (Market.Props memory) {
    bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encode(
        "GMX_MARKET",
        indexToken,
        longToken,
        shortToken,
        marketType
    ));

    // Existing market check omitted for brevity

    MarketToken marketToken = new MarketToken{salt: salt}(roleStore, dataStore);

    // Rest of the code omitted for brevity
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, we recommend implementing a proper check for existing markets before creating a new one. This can be done by querying the `dataStore` for the existence of a market with the provided parameters (indexToken, longToken, shortToken, marketType) before proceeding with the market creation.



To fix the vulnerability in the `createMarket` function, you need to include a proper check for existing markets before creating a new one. Here's an updated version of the code snippet with the recommended fix:

```solidity
function createMarket(
    address indexToken,
    address longToken,
    address shortToken,
    bytes32 marketType
) external onlyMarketKeeper returns (Market.Props memory) {
    bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encode(
        "GMX_MARKET",
        indexToken,
        longToken,
        shortToken,
        marketType
    ));

    bytes32 marketSaltHash = MarketStoreUtils.getMarketSaltHash(salt);
    address existingMarketAddress = dataStore.getAddress(marketSaltHash);
    if (existingMarketAddress != address(0)) {
        revert Errors.MarketAlreadyExists(salt, existingMarketAddress);
    }

    MarketToken marketToken = new MarketToken{salt: salt}(roleStore, dataStore);

    Market.Props memory market = Market.Props(
        address(marketToken),
        indexToken,
        longToken,
        shortToken
    );

    MarketStoreUtils.set(dataStore, address(marketToken), salt, market);

    emitMarketCreated(address(marketToken), salt, indexToken, longToken, shortToken);

    return market;
}
```
