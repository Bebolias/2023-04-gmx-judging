# The claimable collateral amount is always zero, because the collateral factor is never initialized or adapted or updated.

## Summary

Collateral amount given back to a user is based on the collateral factor. But the protocol never initializes or updates the collateral factor, which means the collateral factor always defaults to zero, rendering the claimable collateral amount to always be zero for the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

The claimable collateral amount is calculated inside the function `MarketUtils.claimCollateral`, which multiplies the `claimableAmount` with the `claimableFactor` to determine the `adjustedClaimableAmount` on line 653.

The `claimableFactor` is retrieved from the `dataStore` using the `Keys.claimableCollateralAmountKey` that uses dynamic arguments like `timeKey` and `account`. This indicates that the `claimableFactor` is calculated dynamically and is not set by governance. Yet, the protocol never updates the claimable factor, so it always defaults to zero.

As a consequence, the claimable collateral amount for a user will always be calculated to be zero, because the claimable factor always defaults to zero.

This also means that when the user calls the `ExchangeRouter.claimCollateral` function, the `MarketUtils.claimCollateral` will revert on line 655, because the `adjustedClaimableAmount`, which is zero, is equal to the `claimedAmount`, which is also zero.

## Impact

Users can't claim their collateral, even if there is collateral available to be claimed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Functionality should be added to the protocol to initialize and/or update the claimable collateral factor.
