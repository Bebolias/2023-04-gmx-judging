# XDZIBEC-Uninitialized tokenBalances mapping in StrictBank._afterTransferOut function allows for theft of tokens

## Summary

There is a vulnerability in the `_afterTransferOut` function so it's show the `tokenBalances` mapping is not initialized. this means that the `_afterTransferOut` function will always set the `tokenBalances` mapping to the` current balance` of the `token` in the contract. this could allow an attacker to exploit the `_afterTransferOut` function to steal `tokens` from the contract

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    // @dev update the internal balance after tokens have been transferred out
    // this is called from the Bank contract
    // @param token the token that was transferred out
    function _afterTransferOut(address token) internal override {
        tokenBalances[token] = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    }
}
```

The vulnerability is that the `_afterTransferOut` function in the `StrictBank` contract, the function is declared as function `_afterTransferOut(address token) internal override { tokenBalances[token] = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)); }.` The vulnerability is that the `tokenBalances mapping `is `not initialized`. This means that the `_afterTransferOut` function will always `set` the `tokenBalances` mapping to the current balance of the token in the contract. This could allow an attacker to exploit the `_afterTransferOut` function to steal `tokens` from the contract.

## Impact

An attacker can  exploit the `_afterTransferOut` function is leading to steal `tokens` from the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

-to fix this vulnerability is to initialize the` tokenBalances` mapping in the constructor of the `StrictBank` contract.
