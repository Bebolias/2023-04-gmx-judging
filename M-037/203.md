# `isPositionLiquidatable` should not consider the funding fee because the funding fee can still be claimed after liquidation

## Summary

The `isPositionLiquidatable` function will judge whether the position can be liquidated according to the value of the position. The funding fee should not be taken into consideration, because even if the position is liquidated, the user can still claim the funding fee.
