# Un-existent feature to disable the freezing orders

## Summary
GMX forgot to add a feature enables/disabled for the `freezeOrder` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The entire codebase from GMX is done so that they can pause or disable any feature in the handler contracts, I believe they have that built in as a circuit breaker if any attack happens or simply to feel more in control of the contracts. There is the exception of `freezeOrder`  which is the only feature where they forgot to add the validation whether the feature is disabled or not.

I believe they forgot because everything is enforced in the handlers and the freezing function exists on the utils contracts.

## Impact
If in the future any attack happens, GMX will not be able to respond in the feature of freezing orders, breaking composability with the rest of the codebase.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As a validation as to keep consistent with the existing design. In this case, is should be something similar to the follwoing:

```solidity
 FeatureUtils.validateFeature(params.contracts.dataStore, Keys.FreezeOrderFeatureDisabledKey(address(this), uint256(params.order.orderType())));
```
