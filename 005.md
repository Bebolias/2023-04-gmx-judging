# RoleStore contract lacks proper access control

## Summary

The RoleStore contract does not have proper access control in its methods, allowing any user to call methods that should be restricted to ROLE_ADMIN.

## Vulnerability Detail

The methods `grantRole` and `revokeRole` in the RoleStore contract should only be accessible by ROLE_ADMIN. However, the contract does not implement proper access control to restrict access to these methods.

## Impact

This vulnerability allows any user to add or remove any role for any address, bypassing the intended access control and compromising the security of the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement proper access control by adding the `onlyRoleAdmin` modifier to the methods `grantRole` and `revokeRole`. Alternatively, consider using the OpenZeppelin AccessControl contract to manage roles.
