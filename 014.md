# Lack of Error Handling and Revert Messages

## Summary

Order.sol does not include error handling or revert messages, which may make it difficult to identify and debug issues.

## Vulnerability Detail

Functions such as `setTriggerPrice`, `setAcceptablePrice`, and `setSizeDeltaUsd` do not include error handling or revert messages to notify users of invalid input or potential issues.

## Impact

Lack of error handling and revert messages can result in unexpected behavior, making it challenging to debug issues or identify potential attacks.
