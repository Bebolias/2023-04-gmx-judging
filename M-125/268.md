# Wrong comparison operators

## Summary
Wrong comparison operators according to the docs

## Vulnerability Detail
While setting order prices, there are different requirements for increase and decrease orders. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/BaseOrderUtils.sol#L242-L247

As you can see it should validate that primary prices are smaller or bigger than trigger prices depending if the order is of type increase or decrease.

However when the implementation comes,

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/BaseOrderUtils.sol#L250

it does also accept if orders have the same price, failing to behave as intended by the documentation.

## Impact
Code should revert when primary price it is equal to trigger price and the order should not be executed

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Follow your own documentation and do remove the `=` from the comparison for  `shouldValidateSmallerPrimaryPrice ` to return true or false.

```solidity
if(primaryPrice == triggerPrice ) revert;
 bool ok = shouldValidateSmallerPrimaryPrice ? primaryPrice < triggerPrice : primaryPrice > triggerPrice; 
```
