# No grace period after sequencer outage

## Summary

There is no liquidation grace period after sequencer outages


## Vulnerability Detail

```text
Consider you have deployed a lending protocol on L2, and its sequencer goes down. This has happened in the past and may happen in the future. When the sequencer comes back online and oracles update their prices, all price movements that occurred during downtime are applied at once. If these movements are significant, they may cause chaos. Borrowers would rush to save their positions, while liquidators would rush to liquidate borrowers. Since liquidations are handled mainly by bots, borrowers are likely to suffer mass liquidations.

This is unfair to borrowers, as they could not act on their positions even if they wanted to due to the L2 downtime.

## Impact

Users may be too slow to manually submit orders to prevent liquidation, when they otherwise would have liked to.


## Code Snippet

Since the code doesn't user a sequencer oracle, there is no grace period, and things would have to be done manually:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/LiquidationHandler.sol : LiquidationHandler.executeLiquidation()   #1

60            BaseOrderUtils.ExecuteOrderParams memory params = _getExecuteOrderParams(key, oracleParams, msg.sender, startingGas);
61    
62 @>         FeatureUtils.validateFeature(params.contracts.dataStore, Keys.executeOrderFeatureDisabledKey(address(this), uint256(params.order.orderType())));
63    
64            OrderUtils.executeOrder(params);
65:       }
```

## Recommendation

Since the sequencer issue from the [prior contest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/151) mentioned archive oracles will stop signing prices when the sequencer goes down, the config keepers could also disable the liquidation feature in such cases, in an automated way. Note that giving a grace period may lead to insolvency, so blindly disabling liquidations without doing any other health checks is not recommended.
