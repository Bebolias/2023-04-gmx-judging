# Block hash reorg protection is insufficient after 255 blocks

## Summary

After 255 blocks, the actual block hash no longer appears in payloads signed by the oracle archive nodes, which means the wrong prices can be used to execute orders


## Vulnerability Detail

Prior to 255 blocks passing, the block hash is included in the payloads of signatures that the oracle archive nodes provide. This is to prevent the signature from being re-used when there is a block re-org. However, after 255 blocks, the oracle archive nodes use a value of zero as the block hash, meaning that these signatures can be re-used when there's a re-org.

On Arbitrum, there are multiple blocks a second, so 255 blocks may only equate to a few minutes. Arbitrum transactions can be re-orged if the [L1 is reorged](https://developer.arbitrum.io/learn-more/faq#if-there-is-a-dispute-can-my-l2-transaction-get-reorged--thrown-out--yeeted).


## Impact

Consider the case where a user submits a long position opening order at block N, the position is at a large loss until N+254, and then turns to a large profit at which point the user closes it at N+257. If there is a reorg back to N+250, such that there are 10 more blocks in between the original N and N+254, the user's order to close will now occur during the point in time during which their order was still in a large loss, and the loss will be realized. There is no reasonable way for the user to undo their order (outside of manually attempting to submit a new transaction using the same txn nonce), and keepers will blindly apply the zero-hash-signature, since that's what's available to execute the order.


## Code Snippet

The block hash is only changed from zero if it's within the minimum number of confirmations, and the block hash assigned comes from a call to Chain.getBlockHash(), which resolves to `blockhash()` or `arbSys.arbBlockHash()`, both of which [return zero](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/47c8ba087ecae5e9f15a0375818848b14e98eca8/precompiles/ArbSys.go#L49-L55) if the block is older than 255 blocks:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/oracle/Oracle.sol : Oracle._setPrices()   #1

447                if (Chain.currentBlockNumber() - reportInfo.minOracleBlockNumber <= cache.minBlockConfirmations) {
448 @>                 reportInfo.blockHash = Chain.getBlockHash(reportInfo.minOracleBlockNumber);
449:               }

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

The oracle archives should track reorgs, and recalculate stale prices and signatures when they're requested. If the signature is for an order that is older than 255 blocks, the oracle archive should include in the signed payload, a block number and its hash, from a block still within the last 255 blocks. In other words, there always needs to be a block hash used, never zero, and it may come from any block within the last 255 blocks, as long as that block number is greater than or equal to the order's block.
