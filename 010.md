# Lack of Access Control

## Summary

The `_swap` function in the SwapUtils.sol contract lacks proper access control, which could lead to unauthorized access and potential manipulation.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_swap` function is an internal function that performs the actual swap operation. However, there are no access control mechanisms in place to restrict access to this function. This could potentially allow unauthorized users to call the function and manipulate the swap process.

## Impact

Lack of access control on the `_swap` function could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the swap process, which could have negative consequences for the protocol and its users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to the `_swap` function. This can be done by using the `onlyOwner` or `onlyRole` modifiers provided by the OpenZeppelin Contracts library. Additionally, ensure that only authorized users can call the function to maintain security and prevent unauthorized manipulation.
