# Deposits/Withdrawals/Orders that do not get executed within ~8 minutes will not be executable

## Summary

The issue rises when the operations are executed with a delay. 

There are many reasons Deposits/Withdrawals/Orders will not get executed within ~8 minutes - examples:
1. For maintenance or other operational reasons, the protocol has the ability to disable operations such as deposits, withdrawals and order. 
2. Keeper network availability

Operations will not be executable because of `blockhash` limitations and signature matching.

## Vulnerability Detail

Oracle messages are signed along the `blockhash` of the `minOracleBlockNumber`. According to corresponding chains specs - `blockhash` is limited to 256 previous blocks. Any block below that will result in `0` as the `blockhash`.

The protocol holds a configuration called `MIN_ORACLE_BLOCK_CONFIRMATIONS` which caps the amount of blocks since `minOracleBlockNumber` that will be used to retrieve a `blockhash` according to the sponsor, this is used to control the number of supported previous blocks (256 on ethereum).

```solidity
          if (Chain.currentBlockNumber() - reportInfo.minOracleBlockNumber <= cache.minBlockConfirmations) {
                reportInfo.blockHash = Chain.getBlockHash(reportInfo.minOracleBlockNumber);
            }
```

On avalanche, blocks are finalized every 1-2 seconds. This sets the time for 256 blocks to be finalized between ~4-~8 minutes. 
if `MIN_ORACLE_BLOCK_CONFIRMATIONS` is set to less (100) this can ~1-~3 minutes.

In case `minBlockConfirmations` or 256 blocks have passed, the `blockhash` will be `0`. This will lead to oracle signature not matching the generated digest. This is because oracle signatures are **ALWAYS** signed with the correct `blockhash`.

## Impact

1. Users funds might be stuck due to cancelations being disabled or allowed after a long time
2. Keeper will waste gas attempting to execute the operation
4. Users will need to re-create the operation at possibly less-profitable terms
5. Users will need to pay extra funds to get their funds back since cancelling operations cost gas

## Recommendation

* While `blockhash` is used to prevent using old prices in re-org situations. Chains like avalanche do not need to worry regarding reorgs:

* If `MIN_ORACLE_BLOCK_CONFIRMATIONS` have passed since creation of the operation, compensate the user either by credit or top up of the refunded execution fee
