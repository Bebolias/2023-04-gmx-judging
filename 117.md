# WNT transfered to `holdingAddress` will be ignored by `recordTransferIn`

## Summary

If the transfer of WNT to the receiver fails, WNT will be transferred to the `holdingAddress` address. This part of WNT will not be calculated by `recordTransferIn` function, so the user will not revert after failing to transfer WNT but will be considered as transferring 0 WNT.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`sendWnt`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/router/ExchangeRouter.sol#L90-L93) function is usually used to transfer WNT to protocol, and protocol use [`recordTransferIn`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/bank/StrictBank.sol#L51-L57) function to determine how much WNT the user transfers in. Such logic is used in many places, such as `createDeposit`, `createOrder`, `updateOrder`, `createWithdrawal`.

The `sentWnt` function will further call the [`TokenUtils.sol#transfer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/token/TokenUtils.sol#L48-L93) function to transfer. Once `TokenUtils.sol#transfer` fails to transfer to `receiver`, it will transfer to `holdingAddress` instead. So it may happen that the transfer to the protocol fails but the transfer to the holdingAddress succeeds. Once this happens, the WNT transferred by the user will not be calculated by the `recordTransferIn` function, and the protocol considers that the user transfers 0 WNT.

## Impact

```solidity
File: exchange/OrderHandler.sol
 95         // allow topping up of executionFee as frozen orders
 96         // will have their executionFee reduced
 97         address wnt = TokenUtils.wnt(dataStore);
 98         uint256 receivedWnt = orderVault.recordTransferIn(wnt);
 99         order.setExecutionFee(order.executionFee() + receivedWnt);
```

Take `updateOrder` as an example, if the user adds `executionFee` and the above situation occurs, then the `executionFee` is considered to be 0, and the user loses funds.

## Recommendation

It is recommended that `recordTransferIn` include the WNT transferred to `holdingAddress`
