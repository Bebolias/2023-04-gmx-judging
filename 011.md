# Possible Out-of-Bounds Access

## Summary

Withdrawal library has the potential for out-of-bounds access. The `Props` struct in the library is used to avoid the "Stack too deep" error when passed as memory. It contains 3 sub-structs: `Addresses`, `Numbers`, and `Flags`. The `Addresses` struct has two dynamically-sized arrays, `longTokenSwapPath` and `shortTokenSwapPath`. However, the lengths of these arrays are not checked before accessing them. An attacker can craft a malicious withdrawal transaction and provide a large number of addresses to be pushed to these arrays. Then, they can use the `setLongTokenSwapPath` or `setShortTokenSwapPath` functions to set these arrays, passing an out-of-bounds index that points to a memory location outside the array.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Addresses` sub-struct has two dynamically-sized arrays:

```solidity
struct Addresses {
        ...
        address[] longTokenSwapPath;
        address[] shortTokenSwapPath;
}
```

These arrays are used to set the path for swapping long and short tokens. However, the lengths of these arrays are not checked before accessing them. For example, `setLongTokenSwapPath` function allows setting any index of the `longTokenSwapPath` array without checking whether the index is within the bounds of the array.

```solidity
function setLongTokenSwapPath(Props memory props, address[] memory value) internal pure {
        props.addresses.longTokenSwapPath = value;
}
```

An attacker can craft a malicious transaction with an extremely large array of addresses that will be pushed to `longTokenSwapPath` array. Then, they can use the `setLongTokenSwapPath` function to set this array, passing an out-of-bounds index that points to a memory location outside the array. This will cause the function to write the value to an arbitrary memory location outside of the `longTokenSwapPath` array, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

## Impact

This vulnerability can be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Ethereum network, leading to a loss of funds, among other possible outcomes. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to write arbitrary values to memory locations outside of the `longTokenSwapPath` array, leading to a possible denial-of-service attack, or code execution.

## Tool used

This vulnerability was discovered using manual review.

## Recommendation

To fix this vulnerability, the Withdrawal library should check the length of the `longTokenSwapPath` and `shortTokenSwapPath` arrays before accessing them. The checks should be placed in the setter functions `setLongTokenSwapPath` and `setShortTokenSwapPath`.

```solidity
function setLongTokenSwapPath(Props memory props, address[] memory value) internal pure {
    require(value.length <= MAX_LENGTH, "longTokenSwapPath is too long");
    props.addresses.longTokenSwapPath = value;
}

function setShortTokenSwapPath(Props memory props, address[] memory value) internal pure {
    require(value.length <= MAX_LENGTH, "shortTokenSwapPath is too long");
    props.addresses.shortTokenSwapPath = value;
}
```

Where `MAX_LENGTH` is the maximum allowed.
