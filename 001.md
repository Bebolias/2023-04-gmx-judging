# Lock Governace Ownership

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
1. if the pendingGov variable is set to the zero address, it can result in a loss of control over the contract. This means that the current governor or any other authorized parties will no longer be able to access or update the contract, effectively locking it.
2. If the contract holds any funds or assets, it may not be possible to withdraw them since the zero address has no private key and cannot sign transactions. This could result in a permanent loss of these funds or assets.
3. f the contract provides any critical services or functionality, such as managing important data or executing essential operations, the loss of control could result in disruptions or even serious consequences.

## Recommendation
Use of correct input validation to prevent setting the address to the zero address "address(0)"
e.g  require(_newGov !=address(0),"null address")
