# Unbounded Loop in setPrices()

## Summary

An unbounded loop exists in the `setPrices()` function, potentially causing a denial of service (DoS) attack due to high gas costs or exceeding the block gas limit.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `setPrices()` function in the Oracle.sol contract contains an unbounded loop that iterates through the `tokensWithPrices` set. The `tokensWithPrices` set stores tokens with prices that have been set in the Oracle contract. A potential attacker could manipulate the contract by setting an excessive number of token prices, causing the loop to iterate through an extensive number of entries. This would result in high gas costs or exceeding the block gas limit, effectively causing a DoS attack on the contract.

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < length; i++) {
    address token = tokensWithPrices.at(0);
    delete primaryPrices[token];
    delete secondaryPrices[token];
    delete customPrices[token];
    tokensWithPrices.remove(token);
}
```

## Impact

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a DoS attack on the contract by exploiting the unbounded loop, which would result in high gas costs or exceeding the block gas limit. This would render the contract unusable, affecting all users of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Introduce a limit on the number of tokens that can be set with prices in the `tokensWithPrices` set to prevent an attacker from causing a DoS attack. Additionally, consider implementing a pagination mechanism for clearing token prices to mitigate the risk of exceeding the block gas limit.
