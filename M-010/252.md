# Using spot prices with moving averages will lead to orders not being executed, and liquidations

## Summary

If a token has a Chainlink oracle, that oracle is used to validate the price range, regardless of the type of oracle the market is using.


## Vulnerability Detail

Markets support a 'oracle type' which is meant to allow oracles to sign different types of prices, for example, TWAP prices. If one of these TWAP oracle markets uses a token that has a Chainlink oracle, it's possible for the Chainlink spot price (the reference price) to spike up much higher than the TWAP oracle price.


## Impact

When the price difference between the TWAP price and the Chainlink price spikes to more than the defensive parameter `MAX_ORACLE_REF_PRICE_DEVIATION_FACTOR`, any keepers that attempt to execute resting order (e.g. stop-loss orders with a trigger price that should be used to close the position), will have their executions rejected. At this point, all orders, including liquidations will be unable to execute until the price drops back below the maximum, or the maximum is increased. Once the price becomes executable again, there is a race condition between which gets executed first - a user's stop-loss order, or the liquidation that would happen at the new price. If the liquidation happens first, the user will have lost all of their funds, when they thought they were protected.


## Code Snippet

Chainlink prices are used regardless of the oracle type:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/oracle/Oracle.sol : Oracle._setPrices()   #1

518                (bool hasPriceFeed, uint256 refPrice) = _getPriceFeedPrice(dataStore, reportInfo.token);
519 @>             if (hasPriceFeed) {
520                    validateRefPrice(
521                        reportInfo.token,
522                        medianMinPrice,
523                        refPrice,
524                        cache.maxRefPriceDeviationFactor
525                    );
526    
527                    validateRefPrice(
528                        reportInfo.token,
529                        medianMaxPrice,
530                        refPrice,
531                        cache.maxRefPriceDeviationFactor
532                    );
533:               }
```

And keeper operations will revert until the difference decreases:

```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/oracle/Oracle.sol : Oracle.validateRefPrice()   #2

569        function validateRefPrice(
570            address token,
571            uint256 price,
572            uint256 refPrice,
573            uint256 maxRefPriceDeviationFactor
574        ) internal pure {
575            uint256 diff = Calc.diff(price, refPrice);
576            uint256 diffFactor = Precision.toFactor(diff, refPrice);
577    
578            if (diffFactor > maxRefPriceDeviationFactor) {
579 @>             revert Errors.MaxRefPriceDeviationExceeded(
580                    token,
581                    price,
582                    refPrice,
583                    maxRefPriceDeviationFactor
584                );
585            }
586:       }
```

## Recommendation

Don't allow Chainlink reference prices to be used when the oracle type isn't a spot oracle type
