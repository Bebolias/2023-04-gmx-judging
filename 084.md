# Previous audits issue #177 is not effectively fixed

## Summary

Previous audits [issue #177](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/177) is not effectively fixed

## Vulnerability Detail

The [fix](https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-synthetics/pull/113/commits/0021c550b85670e598f48a35a3685bb163f7d7e5) just add a new error and revert it, but the new error is not included in `OracleUtils.isEmptyPriceError()`. Therefore, the implementation before and after the fix is the same, and revert occurs after the price is negative.

## Impact

Orders to close positions will be canceled, leading to losses.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/oracle/Oracle.sol#L604-L606

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include the new error in the list of `OracleUtils.isEmptyPriceError()` errors
