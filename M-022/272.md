# Price Impact calculated after Updating OI for Increase Orders

## Summary
The price impact for increase orders is calculated using updated Open Interest ie. adding the amount this position increase order is going to add to OI after this order is executed. This yields inaccurate Price impact Value which is then checked in ensuring that the position is not liquidatable. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In the ```IncreasePosition``` function in ```IncreasePositionUtils.sol``` first the Open Interest gets updated (funds newly introduced through this increase order) through the ```updateOpenInterest``` function and then later ```validatePosition``` function is called. This function calls ```isPositionLiquidatable``` to check if the resulting position will be liquidatable. There the resulting ```remainingCollateralUsd``` is calculated after adjusting for fees, pnl, price impact etc. and this ```remainingCollateralUsd``` is then used to ensure that the resulting collateral of this position will not be below ```MIN_COLLATERAL_USD```.

```solidity
cache.remainingCollateralUsd =
            cache.collateralUsd.toInt256()
            + cache.positionPnlUsd
            + cache.priceImpactUsd
            - collateralCostUsd.toInt256();
```

The problem is that this ```cache.priceImpactUsd``` is being calculated after the Open Interest has already been modified for these new fund inflows as explained above.

```solidity
cache.priceImpactUsd = PositionPricingUtils.getPriceImpactUsd(
            PositionPricingUtils.GetPriceImpactUsdParams(
                dataStore,
                market,
                cache.usdDeltaForPriceImpact,
                position.isLong()
            )
        );
```
Therefore an inaccurate price impact will be used for checking liquidation which will prevent some deserving positions from being opened/increased. Whereas in [DecreasePositionUtils.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/06ccd8c7ee4cadc46e3ac412dcf141eefdced42f/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionUtils.sol#L277) the Open Interest is only updated after the position has been validated.

## Impact
This price impact would be inaccurate to the actual price impact experienced. Therefore some positions may be errantly prevented from being opened with this validation( for negative price impact values, the ```remainingCollateral``` will degrade by higher severity because the Open interest has been increased and thus price impact will be lower negative value than it originally should be, this negative price impact is simply added to ```remainingCollateralUsd```).

```solidity
 PositionUtils.updateOpenInterest(
            params,
            params.order.sizeDeltaUsd().toInt256(),
            cache.sizeDeltaInTokens.toInt256()
        );

        MarketUtils.validateReserve(
            params.contracts.dataStore,
            params.market,
            prices,
            params.order.isLong()
        );

        PositionUtils.validatePosition(
            params.contracts.dataStore,
            params.contracts.referralStorage,
            params.position,
            params.market,
            prices,
            true, // isIncrease
            true, // shouldValidateMinPositionSize
            true // shouldValidateMinCollateralUsd
        );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update Open Interest only after the position has been validated. Just like DecreasePositionUtils.sol
