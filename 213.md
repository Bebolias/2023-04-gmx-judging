## Summary

The vulnerability in the` withdraw()` function does not handle overdrawn `withdrawals`, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability and leading to loss of funds for users.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
*/
interface IWNT {
    function deposit() external payable;
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external;
}
```
The vulnerability in `IWNT.sol` contract is in the` withdraw()` function it's does not handle `overdrawn` withdrawals, this means that if a user tries to` withdraw` more` tokens` than they have `deposited`, the function will simply try to` transfer` the requested amount of `tokens`, even though there are not enough` tokens` available, this allow an attacker to steal funds form users.



## Impact

- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability and leading to steal funds from users  if they try to withdraw more tokens than they have deposited.
- The function might fail to transfer any tokens at all
