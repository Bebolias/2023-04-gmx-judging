# Missing Access Control in Router.sol

## Summary

The `Router` contract in Router.sol does not implement any access control, allowing any address to call the `pluginTransfer` function and potentially steal tokens from other users.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `Router` contract, the `pluginTransfer` function is designed to transfer tokens on behalf of users. However, there is no access control mechanism in place to ensure that only authorized addresses can call this function.

## Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to steal tokens from other users by calling the `pluginTransfer` function with the victim's address as the `account` parameter. This could lead to a significant loss of funds for users and potentially undermine the trust in the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement proper access control mechanisms for the `pluginTransfer` function, such as using OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` or a custom role-based access control system. Additionally, consider adding tests and documentation to ensure the intended access control is in place.
