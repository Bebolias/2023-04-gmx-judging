# The gas fee when `withOraclePrices` is not included so the gas fee got by the keeper may be less than the spent

## Summary

During execution, the `startingGas` starts to be counted after `withOraclePrices`, resulting in the gas fee spent during `withOraclePrices` not being counted, and this part of the implementation is quite a lot.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/DepositHandler.sol#L100

Take `executeDeposit` as an example. Execute `withOraclePrices` (line 98) before starting to calculate the gas fee (line 100). `setPrices` and `clearAllPrices` is not counted to gas gee.

## Impact

The implementation of `setPrices` is not simple, which may cause the keeper to lose money.
