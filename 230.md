# Stop-loss orders are broken for certain use cases.

## Summary

* Stop-loss orders fail to execute when the `secondaryPrice` is smaller than the `triggerPrice` for a short.
* Stop-loss orders fail to execute when the `secondaryPrice` is bigger than the `triggerPrice` for a long.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the code snippet below on line 280, the `ok` boolean will be false if the `secondaryPrice` is smaller/bigger than the `triggerPrice` for a short/long. Thus triggering the `Errors.InvalidStopLossOrderPrices` revert on line 285.

## Impact

If the secondary price is smaller than the trigger price for a short, or if the secondary price is bigger than the trigger price for a long, the stop-loss order execution will revert. Thus rendering users exposed to their position, even if they had a valid stop-loss set.

## Recommendation

If the secondary price is smaller/bigger than the trigger price for a short/long, don't [revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/OrderHandler.sol#L269).
