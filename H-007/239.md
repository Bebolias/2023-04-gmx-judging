# Primary price is used for market orders, rather than secondary prices

## Summary

Market orders use the primary (oldest) price for market orders, rather than the secondary (fresher) price


## Vulnerability Detail

Oracle prices cover a range of blocks, and that range may contain multiple prices. By looking at the primary price of the current block range, an attacker can submit market orders when the price at the beginning of the range (the primary price) is different from the current prevailing price, then exit the position in the same block using a limit order, which will use the trigger or acceptable price. An attacker can compile statistics on oracle signatures, in order to time things perfectly every time, to automate the attack.

Note that this is almost the same issue as was submitted for the last contest, but was [rejected](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/169) due to the example provided.


## Impact

Users will get unfair execution prices, leading to unfair losses for the other side of the trade.


## Code Snippet

Uses the primary price, rather than the secondary price:

```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/BaseOrderUtils.sol : BaseOrderUtils.setExactOrderPrice()   #1

221            bool shouldUseMaxPrice = isIncrease ? isLong : !isLong;
222    
223            if (orderType == Order.OrderType.MarketIncrease ||
224                orderType == Order.OrderType.MarketDecrease ||
225                orderType == Order.OrderType.Liquidation) {
226    
227 @>             Price.Props memory price = oracle.getPrimaryPrice(indexToken);
228    
229                oracle.setCustomPrice(indexToken, Price.Props(
230                    price.pickPrice(shouldUseMaxPrice),
231                    price.pickPrice(shouldUseMaxPrice)
232                ));
233    
234                return;
235            }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Use the secondary price so that they get the newer price or the acceptable price, whichever is smaller
