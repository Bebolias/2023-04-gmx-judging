# MarketFactory allows creating a market with zero-address tokens

## Summary

The current implementation of the `createMarket` function in the MarketFactory contract allows creating a market with zero-address tokens (indexToken, longToken, or shortToken). This could lead to unexpected behavior and loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `createMarket` function, there is no check to ensure that `indexToken`, `longToken`, and `shortToken` are not zero-addresses.

## Impact

This vulnerability allows the creation of markets with zero-address tokens, leading to unexpected behavior, confusion for users, and potential loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add checks in the `createMarket` function to ensure that `indexToken`, `longToken`, and `shortToken` are not zero-addresses:

```solidity
require(indexToken != address(0), "Index token must not be zero address");
require(longToken != address(0), "Long token must not be zero address");
require(shortToken != address(0), "Short token must not be zero address");
```
