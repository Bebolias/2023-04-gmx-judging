# Depositing through `ExchangeRouter` requires sending tokens to depositVault beforehand, which allows frontrunning.

## Summary
Users have to send long token, short token, and some wnt (execution fee), before calling `ExchangeRouter#createDeposit`. This allows MEV bots and other attackers to steal them through frontrunning.

## Vulnerability Detail
To [accept a user's deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/DepositUtils.sol#L77-L78)), the protocol uses [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/bank/StrictBank.sol#L51-L57) to calculate the amount of tokens the user is sending.
The `_recordTransferIn` function assumes that the difference between the current `tokenBalance` of the vault and the last cached `tokenBalance` of the vault is equal to the amount that the user sent, then updates the cached `tokenBalance` of the vault to the current balance.
The problem is that, the user MUST have sent the tokens to the depositVault before calling `createDeposit`, else the call would fail. This gives room for attackers to steal the amount of funds that a user was intending to deposit by frontrunning them.
Imagine this scenario:
- UserA wants to create a deposit, so he first sends x long tokens, y short tokens, and z wnt(for execution fee)
- UserA calls `createDeposit` after transferring the tokens to the depositVault
- Attacker or MEV bots sees these transactions in mempool, and then calls createDeposit with exact same parameters as UserA and higher gas(without transferring any tokens before hand)
- Attacker's transaction gets executed before UserA's
- Attacker calls `cancelDeposit` to get back the long and short tokens, or waits for deposit to be executed to receive marketTokens
- UserA loses his funds

NOTE: attacker can as well steal executionFee of other users during withdrawal 

## Impact
Users that want to deposit will lose their funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider allowing users to set an approval, then `transferFrom` the tokens from the user to depositVault instead of `_recordTransferIn` function
