# Negative prices will cause old orders to be canceled (same as previous audit)

## Summary

This was an issue from the previous Sherlock audit: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/177

In the above issue it was stated *"Although unlikely the possibility of this must be addressed instead of canceling it"* which is not case in the new code. A new error was added and thrown correctly as suggested, but not caught in the `_handleOrderError` function and so the order is still cancelled.

## Vulnerability Detail

Same as previous audit.

## Impact

Same as previous audit.

## Code Snippet

Negative price causes custom error revert:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/oracle/Oracle.sol : Oracle._setPricesFromPriceFeeds()   #1

        if (_price <= 0) {
            revert Errors.InvalidFeedPrice(token, _price);
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add new error to the list of oracle errors in `_handleOrderError` that result in the tx being reverted with `ErrorUtils.revertWithCustomError`
