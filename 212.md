# XDZIBEC-Withdrawal function does not check for successful native token transfer

## Summary

The `withdraw()` function burns `WNT` tokens and then calls the `msg.sender.call{ value: amount }` function to `withdraw` the native tokens, the `msg.sender.call{ value: amount }` function does not check to see if the `withdrawal` was successful. this means that an attacker could call the `withdraw()` function and burn `WNT` tokens, but the attacker would not necessarily receive the native tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
 // @dev withdraw the native token by burning WNT
    // @param amount the amount to withdraw
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amount }("");
        if (!success) {
            revert TransferFailed(msg.sender, amount);
        }
    }
```

- The vulnerability is in the `withdraw()` function, 
- The `withdraw()` function burns `WNT` tokens by calling the `_burn() function`. The `_burn() `function decreases the balance of the `msg.sender` account by the specified `amount`, After the `WNT` tokens have been `burned`, the `withdraw()` function calls the `msg.sender.call{ value: amount }` function to` withdraw` the native` tokens`. The `msg.sender.call()` function sends a message to the `msg.sender` account with the specified `amount` of native `tokens`, The `msg.sender.call()` function does not check to see if the `withdrawal` was successful. This means that the `withdraw()` function does not know if the native `tokens` were actually `withdrawn`.


## Impact

-This vulnerability allows the attacker to steal `WNT` tokens from users and ,could be locked out of their account,and lose access to their funds.

- An attacker can  exploited this vulnerability  as follows:
    - The attacker would call the` withdraw()` function and specify a large amount of `WNT` tokens to be `withdrawn`.
    - The `withdraw()` function would `burn` the specified amount of `WNT` tokens from the attacker's account.
    - The` withdraw()` function would call the `msg.sender.call{ value: amount }` function to `withdraw` the native tokens.
    - The attacker would not receive the native `tokens`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- adding a check to the `withdraw()` function to see if the native token transfer was successful
 an example :
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
    _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amount, gas: 90000 }("");
    if (!success) {
        revert TransferFailed(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```
the `msg.sender.call{ value: amount, gas: 90000 }` function is used to `withdraw` the native tokens. `The gas: 90000` parameter is used to ensure that the `msg.sender.call{ value: amount }` function has enough gas to complete the `withdrawal`.
The if `(!success)` statement checks to see if the `withdrawal` was successful. If the `withdrawal` was not successful, the `revert` `TransferFailed(msg.sender, amount)`, statement is used to revert the transaction and return the `WNT` tokens to the user.
