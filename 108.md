# Wrong formula to calculate the Funding Fees

## Summary
## Vulnerability Detail

In the docs it is clearly stated that the formula used to calculate the price impact is:

```solidity

Funding fees incentivise the balancing of long and short positions, the side with the larger open interest pays a funding fee to the side with the smaller open interest.

Funding fees for the larger side is calculated as `(funding factor per second) * (open interest imbalance) ^ (funding exponent factor) / (total open interest)`.

```
though there is nowhere in the codebase used, the actual formula to calculate the price impact is different to the stated on the docs.

Link to the actual function with the implementation of the formula:
