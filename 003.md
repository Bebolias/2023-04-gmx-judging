# Reentrancy vulnerability

## Summary

The Bank contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the '_transferOut' and '_transferOutNativeToken' functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

The '_transferOut' and '_transferOutNativeToken' functions are used to transfer tokens from the Bank contract to a receiver. However, there is no reentrancy protection in place, which could lead to potential reentrancy attacks if a malicious receiver is called.

## Impact

An attacker can use a malicious receiver contract to exploit the reentrancy vulnerability, potentially draining the Bank contract's funds.
