# boundedAdd() might fail to return the result that is bounded to prevent overflows

## Summary
boundedAdd may revert
## Vulnerability Detail
The goal of `boundedAdd` is to bound the result regardless what the inputs are to prevent overflows/underflows. However, the goal is not achieved for some cases. As a result, `boundedAdd` still might underflow and still might revert. The goal of the function is not achieved.

As a result, the protocol might not be fault-tolerant as it is supposed to be - when `boundedAdd` is designed to not revert in any case, it still might revert. For example, function MarketUtils.getNextFundingAmountPerSize() will be affected.

a very similar issue is described in the report above

> boundedSub() is designed to always bound its result between type(int256).min and type(int256).max so that it will never overflow/underflow:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/utils/Calc.sol#L116-L135
It achieves its goal in three cases:
Case 1: if either a or b is zero or the signs are the same there should not be any overflow.
Case 2: a > 0, and b < 0, and a-b > type(int256).max, then we need to return type(int256).max.
Case 3: a < 0, and b > 0, and a - b <  type(int256).min, then we need to return
type(int256).min
Unfortunately, the third case is implemented wrongly as follows:
 // if subtracting `b` from `a` would result in a value less than the min int256 value
        // then return the min int256 value
        if (a < 0 && b <= type(int256).min - a) {
            return type(int256).min;
        }
which essentially is checking a < 0 && b + a <= type(int256).min, a wrong condition to check. Because of using this wrong condition, underflow cases will not be detected and the function will revert instead of returning  type(int256).min in this case.
To verify, suppose a = type(int256).min and b = 1, a-b needs to be bounded to prevent underflow and the function should have returned type(int256).min. However, the function will fail the condition, as a result, it will not execute the if part, and the following final line will be executed instead:
return a - b;
As a result, instead of returning the minimum, the function will revert in the last line due to underflow. This violates the property of the function: it should have returned the bounded result type(int256).min and should not have reverted in any case.
The following POC in Remix can show that the following function will revert:
function testBoundedSub() public pure returns (int256){
              return boundedSub(type(int256).min+3, 4);
}

as we can see from the lines above, the specific logic below is flawed
```solidity
if (a < 0 && b <= type(int256).min - a) {
```
the protocol team rightfully fixes said logic from `boundedSub`, but this logic is also found in `boundedAdd`. Knowing that said logic is flawed, while the protocol team fixed the issue for `boundedSub`, it did not fix the issue in the `boundedAdd` function
```solidity
function boundedAdd(int256 a, int256 b) internal pure returns (int256) {
        // if either a or b is zero or if the signs are different there should not be any overflows
        if (a == 0 || b == 0 || (a < 0 && b > 0) || (a > 0 && b < 0)) {
            return a + b;
        }

        // if adding `b` to `a` would result in a value less than the min int256 value
        // then return the min int256 value
        if (a < 0 && b <= type(int256).min - a) {
            return type(int256).min;
        }

        // if adding `b` to `a` would result in a value more than the max int256 value
        // then return the max int256 value
        if (a > 0 && b >= type(int256).max - a) {
            return type(int256).max;
        }

        return a + b;
    }
``` 
## Impact
`boundedAdd` does not guarantee underflow/overflow free as it is designed to be. As a result, the protocol might break at points when it is not supposed to break.
For example, function MarketUtils.getNextFundingAmountPerSize() will be affected.
