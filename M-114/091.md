# when longToken == shorToken,  double accountings of funding and thus double claimable token amounts become possible.

## Summary
when longToken == shorToken, in contrast to openInterest calculation, which uses a divisor, funding amount calculation does not have 
such divisor mechannism, as a result, double accounting of funding and thus double claimable token amount becomes possible. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the flow ``OrderHandler.executeOrder() -> _executeOrder() -> OrderUtils.executeOrder() -> processOrder() -> IncreaseOrderUtils.processOrder() -> InceasePositionUtils.increasePosition()-> processCollateral()-> PositionPricingUtils.getPositionFees() -> getFundingFees()``, in particular function ``getFundingFees()`` which calculates the claimable funding fees into ``fundingFees.claimableLongTokenAmount`` and ``fundingFees.claimableShortTokenAmount`` respectively. For the purpose of discussion, we assume the trader will receive funding.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/pricing/PositionPricingUtils.sol#L455-L497](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/pricing/PositionPricingUtils.sol#L455-L497]

In contrast to open interest, no divisor mechanism is used for funding calculation. As a result, when longToken = shortToken, ``fundingFees.claimableLongTokenAmount`` and ``fundingFees.claimableShortTokenAmount`` would be equal and a double accounting. 

Such claimable token amount is persisted when the trader is about the complete the order in function  ``InceasePositionUtils.increasePosition()``:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/IncreasePositionUtils.sol#L53-L209](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/IncreasePositionUtils.sol#L53-L209)

At L131, such claimable funding amount is committed by function ``PositionUtils.incrementClaimableFundingAmount()``: 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/PositionUtils.sol#L504-L530](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/PositionUtils.sol#L504-L530)

Since longToken == shortToken, the same funding amount that can be claimed will be incremented twice, a double accounting problem.  

## Impact
when longToken = shorToken,  double accountings of funding and thus double claimable token amounts become possible.

## Recommendation

1) Never allow longToken = shortToken, this is the best solution. The accounting for the edge case of longToken = shortToken is always error-prone. Enforcing longToken != shortToken might be a good idea. 

2) Introduce a divisor as well for funding amount and calculate each number very carefully.
