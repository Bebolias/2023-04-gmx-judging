# Unchecked gas estimation for executing withdrawals leads to exceeding the max gas limits per block

## Summary
When a user creates a withdrawal in the withdrawal store. This function [WithdrawalUtils.createWithdrawal()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/withdrawal/WithdrawalUtils.sol#L101-L166) check the `callbackGasLimit` is not exceeded the max gas limits per block in this line 
```solidity
CallbackUtils.validateCallbackGasLimit(dataStore, withdrawal.callbackGasLimit());
```
## Vulnerability Detail
By going to the next line
```solidity
uint256 estimatedGasLimit = GasUtils.estimateExecuteWithdrawalGasLimit(dataStore, withdrawal);
```
this is the `estimateExecuteWithdrawalGasLimit()` function
```solidity
    function estimateExecuteWithdrawalGasLimit(DataStore dataStore, Withdrawal.Props memory withdrawal) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 gasPerSwap = dataStore.getUint(Keys.singleSwapGasLimitKey());
        uint256 swapCount = withdrawal.longTokenSwapPath().length + withdrawal.shortTokenSwapPath().length;
        uint256 gasForSwaps = swapCount * gasPerSwap;

        return dataStore.getUint(Keys.withdrawalGasLimitKey(false)) + withdrawal.callbackGasLimit() + gasForSwaps;
    }
```
It adds additional gas to the value of  `callbackGasLimit` :
1- `dataStore.getUint(Keys.withdrawalGasLimitKey(false))`
2- `gasForSwaps`

the value of `estimatedGasLimit`  is the one that needs to check to not exceed the max gas limits per block 

Note: the same issue on the other gas estimation logic 

## Impact
- The keeper executing withdrawals will expose Out-of-Gas and will not receive the execution fees

## Recommendation
check the `estimatedGasLimit` value
