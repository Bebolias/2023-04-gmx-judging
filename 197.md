# Inconsistency logic of calculating ``minCollateralUsdForLeverage`` between PositionUtils.isPositionLiquidatable() and PositionUtils.willPositionCollateralBeSufficient().

## Summary
Inconsistency logic of calculating ``minCollateralUsdForLeverage`` between ``PositionUtils.isPositionLiquidatable()`` and ``PositionUtils.willPositionCollateralBeSufficient()``.  Such inconsistency might lead to unnecessary liquidation and loss of funds to the customers.

## Vulnerability Detail
Both ``PositionUtils.isPositionLiquidatable()`` and ``PositionUtils.willPositionCollateralBeSufficient()`` will check whether a position's collateral is sufficient to cover the position size. However, there is an inconsistency in logic in calculating ``minCollateralUsdForLeverage``. In ``isPositionLiquidable``, the ``minCollateralFactor`` is used to calculate  ``minCollateralUsdForLeverage``:

While in function ``willPositionCollateralBeSufficient()``,  the ``MinCollateralFactorForOpenInterest`` is used to calculate ``minCollateralUsdForLeverage``.

Such inconsistency of logic will lead the best as surprise to customers, and the worst of unnecessary liquidation for customers and loss of funds as  a result.

## Impact
Such inconsistency might lead to unnecessary liquidation and loss of funds to the customers.

## Recommendation
Use the same logic for both.
