# Keepers will be undercompensated if `tx.gasPrice` increases exponentially

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
While creating an order, users have to specify an execution fee for the keepers. This execution fee has to be at least the same value as `minExecutionFee ` calculated in the `validateExecutionFee` function.

The problem is that if a user creates the order when the network is not congested it will be much cheaper than if it actually is. 
Airdrops/bullrun etc WRITWW!!
In the case where users create orders with execution fees equal or very similar to `minExecutionFee` and the order gets executed, frozen, or canceled by the keeper when the network gasPrice has increased exponentially, keepers will be massively undercompensated losing funds by having to pay more gasPrice to get the transaction executed, or, if there is an internal pipeline to mitigate this by checking gasPrices and calculating whether it makes sense to execute or not depending on the current gas prices of the network, orders will be affected by taking much longer to get executed or getting frozen.
