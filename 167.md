# MarketUtils.getFundingAmountPerSizeDelta() has a rounding logical error.

## Summary
``MarketUtils.getFundingAmountPerSizeDelta()`` has a rounding logical error. The main problem is the divisor always use a roundupDivision regardless of the input ``roundUp`` rounding mode. Actually the correct use should be: the divisor should use the opposite of ``roundup`` to achieve the same logic of rounding. 


## Vulnerability Detail
``MarketUtils.getFundingAmountPerSizeDelta()`` is used to calculate the ``FundingAmountPerSizeDelta`` with a roundup input mode parameter. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1126-L1136](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1126-L1136)

This function is used for example by the IncreaseLimit order via flow ``OrderHandler.executeOrder() -> _executeOrder() -> OrderUtils.executeOrder() -> processOrder() -> IncreaseOrderUtils.processOrder() -> IncreasePositionUtils.increasePosition() -> PositionUtils.updateFundingAndBorrowingState() -> MarketUtils.updateFundingAmoutPerSize() -> getFundingAmountPerSizeDelta()``.

However, the main problem is the divisor always use a roundupDivision regardless of the input ``roundUp`` rounding mode. Actually the correct use should be: the divisor should use the opposite of ``roundup`` to achieve the same logic of rounding. 

My POC code confirms my finding: given fundingAmount = 2e15, openInterest = 1e15+1, and roundup = true, the correct answer should be: 1999999999999998000000000000001999999999999999. However, the implementation returns the wrong solution of : 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000. The reason is that the divisor uses a roundup and gets a divisor of 2, as a result, the final result is actually rounded down rather than rounding up!

```javascript
function testGetFundingAmountPerSizeDelta() public{
        uint result = MarketUtils.getFundingAmountPerSizeDelta(2e15, 1e15+1, true);
        console2.log("result: %d", result);
        uint256 correctResult = 2e15 * 1e15 * 1e30 + 1e15; // this is a real round up
        correctResult = correctResult/(1e15+1);
        console2.log("correctResult: %d", correctResult);
        assertTrue(result  == 1e15 * 1e30);
    }
```

## Impact
MarketUtils.getFundingAmountPerSizeDelta() has a rounding logical error, sometimes, when roundup = true, the result, instead of rounding up, it becomes a rounding down!

## Recommendation
Change the rounding mode of the divisor to the opposite of the input ``roundup`` mode. Or, the solution can be just as follows: 

```diff
function getFundingAmountPerSizeDelta(
        uint256 fundingAmount,
        uint256 openInterest,
        bool roundUp
    ) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        if (fundingAmount == 0 || openInterest == 0) { return 0; }
     
       

        // how many units in openInterest
-        uint256 divisor = Calc.roundUpDivision(openInterest, Precision.FLOAT_PRECISION_SQRT);

-        return Precision.toFactor(fundingAmount, divisor, roundUp);
+       return Precision.toFactor(fundingAmount*Precision.FLOAT_PRECISION_SQRT, openInterest, roundUp
    }
```
