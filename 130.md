# Malicious keepers can freeze orders by not forwarding enough gas

## Summary
Malicious keeper is able to freeze orders by making them fail because not enough gas is sent with the call.


## Vulnerability Detail
In the order handler, keepers execute the orders through `executeOrder`.

As we know, due to the EIP-150, the EVM forwards 63/64 gas for external calls, allowing them to silently fail and continue the execution with the remaining gas.

A malicious keeper can freeze any order they do not like by forwarding the exact amount of gas so that the external call:

runs out of gas, and fails the `try` block, doing a fallback to the `catch`.

As an error for not enough gas is not handled in the selectors, the `_handleOrderError` call arrives to the freeze order feature:

## Impact
Malicious keeper can freeze any valid user order

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I would add a check at the beginning of the `execute` functions such that gasLeft() if higher than the gas necessary to procces the entire transaction. You also have to calculate first, how much gas is required and add the value to a key
