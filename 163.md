# WithdrawalUtils._executeWithdrawal() fails to consider the positionImactPool when validating market token balance, as a result, overwithdrawl is possibe, leading to possible failure of other functionality, such as insufficient position impact pool, collateral pool, etc.

## Summary
``WithdrawalUtils._executeWithdrawal()`` fails to consider the positionImactPool when validating market token balance, as a result, overwithdrawl is possibe, leading to possible failure of other functionality, such as insufficient position impact pool, collateral pool, etc.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user withdraws market tokens, one of the steps is to check that there are sufficient balances of long/short tokens to cover: poolAmount, collateralForLongs, collateralForShorts, swapImpactPoolAmount, claimableCollateralAmount, claimableFeeAmount, claimableUiFeeAmount, and affiliateRewardAmount.

This is accomplished at L430 of the ``_executeWithdrawal()`` function:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/withdrawal/WithdrawalUtils.sol#L267-L431](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/withdrawal/WithdrawalUtils.sol#L267-L431)

Function ``MarketUtils.validateMarketTokenBalance()`` performs the balance check:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L2301-L2354](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L2301-L2354)

At L2341, it calls ``getExpectedMinTokenBalance()`` to return the minimum balance for long or short token: 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L2356-L2389](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L2356-L2389)

However,  function ``getExpectedMinTokenBalance()`` fails to consider the portion for ``positionImactPool``. As a result, it underestimates the minimum required balance. Therefore, a user might overwithdraw the balance of long/short token, leading to disfunction of the system (lack of swapImpactPool amount, collateral amount, etc). 

## Impact
WithdrawalUtils._executeWithdrawal() fails to consider the ``positionImactPool`` when validating market token balance, as a result, overwithdrawl is possibe, leading to possible failure of other functionality, such as insufficient position impact pool, collateral pool, etc.

## Recommendation
Consider  ``positionImactPool`` in function ``getExpectedMinTokenBalance()``.
