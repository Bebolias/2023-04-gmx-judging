# A single precision value may not work for both the min and max prices

## Summary
The same precision may not work for the min and max prices

## Vulnerability Detail
If the min price reaches the maximum value possible for the specified level of precision, the max price won't be able to use the same precision.

Will reference the ETH example, as the numbers are a bit simpler to reason with

The price of ETH is 5000, and ETH has 18 decimals.
Price would be stored as 5000 / (10 ^ 18) * (10 ^ 30) => 5000 * (10 ^ 12)
If the decimal multiplier value is set to 8, the uint32 value would be 5000 * (10 ^ 12) / (10 ^ 8) => 5000 * (10 ^ 4)

With this config, ETH prices can have a maximum value of (2 ^ 32) / (10 ^ 4) => 4,294,967,296 / (10 ^ 4) => 429,496.7296 with 4 decimals of precision.

If the price of ETH changes to be above 429,496.7296, e.g. 450,000

The decimal multiplier value can be set to 9, the uint32 value would be 450,000 * (10 ^ 12) / (10 ^ 9) => 450,000 * (10 ^ 3)

With this config, ETH prices can have a maximum value of (2 ^ 32) / (10 ^ 3) => 4,294,967,296 / (10 ^ 3) => 4,294,967.296 with 3 decimals of precision.

The mentioned case of requiring different decimals could occur if the min price of ETH is 5000 and the max price of ETH is 450,000, in case that occurs the decimal multiplier value can be set to 9 which may lead to a small amount of precision loss but we feel it is an acceptable outcome.

In case the precision difference required is too large, e.g. 2 decimals or more, we think the oracles should stop signing prices for this case, there could be a need for manual intervention to settle the market as there may be an issue with the price sources in case that occurs.

## Impact
Depending on how the order keepers and oracle archive work, either the fetching the price from the oracle will fail, or the user will get less than they deserve. This may happen when a user is at the border of being liquidated, and it would be unfair to liquidate the user.

## Code Snippet
The same precision is required to be used for both the min and max prices:
```solidity
    ) internal pure {
        bytes32 digest = ECDSA.toEthSignedMessageHash(
            keccak256(abi.encode(
                SALT,
                info.minOracleBlockNumber,
                info.maxOracleBlockNumber,
                info.oracleTimestamp,
                info.blockHash,
                info.token,
                info.tokenOracleType,
                info.precision,
                info.minPrice,
                info.maxPrice
            ))
        );

        address recoveredSigner = ECDSA.recover(digest, signature);

## Recommendation
Provide separate precision values for min and max prices
