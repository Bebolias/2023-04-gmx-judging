# `nonRevertingTransferWithGasLimit` may cost more gas than `GasLimit`

## Summary

The `nonRevertingTransferWithGasLimit` function use high-level `call`, so if a large `returndata` is received, it will cost more gas than `GasLimit`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `returndata` will be loaded into memory and cost large gas.

This implementation is adapted from OpenZeppelin SafeERC20, and this risk is specified in [the implementation of OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L117-L118).

## Impact

The user or keeper may spend more gas than `GasLimit` and cause funds loss.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended that use a low-level call like the [withdrawAndSendNativeToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/token/TokenUtils.sol#L152-L162) function.
