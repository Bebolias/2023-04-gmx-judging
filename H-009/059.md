# Report #130 from previous audit is not fixed and still allows users to do the profit on that

## Summary
Report number 130 from previous audit is not fixed and still allows users to do the profit on that.
## Vulnerability Detail
Inside the report watson recommended to do following:
> Require a delay between when the order was last increased/submitted, and when an update is allowed, similar to [REQUEST_EXPIRATION_BLOCK_AGE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/ExchangeUtils.sol#L24) for the cancellation of market orders

But this was not done. The [change in the PR](https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-synthetics/pull/111/files) allowed [prices for `latestUpdatedAtBlock` to be valid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/DecreaseOrderUtils.sol#L146). So in case if order will not be executed exactly on `latestUpdatedAtBlock` block by keeper, then order owner still can update it after checking the price movement.
## Impact
User can game protocol and change his decision based on future price.
