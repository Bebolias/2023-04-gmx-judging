# Malicious revert reasons with faked lengths can disrupt order execution

## Summary
Malicious revert reasons with faked lengths can disrupt order execution
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/139
> For most order-related operations, the user is allowed to provide the address of a contract on which a callback is triggered, whenever anything related to an order changes. These callbacks are executed with a limited amount of gas, under a try-catch block, in order to ensure that the user-supplied callback cannot affect subsequent processing. Whenever the callback reverts, the revert reason is fetched so that it can be emitted.
The code that parses the return bytes uses abi.decode(result, (string)) to parse the "string", which relies on the first word of the data, to figure out how many bytes long the string is. Because the results variable is a memory variable, rather than calldata, any read past the end of the bytes is allowed, and is considered as value zero byte slots. If a malicious callback provides a reason "string" that is only a few bytes long, but sets the length to a very large number, when the decode call is made, it will try to read a string of that provided length, and will eventually run out of gas.
Note that this is not the same as providing an actual long string, because in that case, the callback will revert with an out of gas error, and there won't be a string to parse.

This issue above has been assumed to be fixed. While the fix does work in the functions provided above, an attacker can still leverage this attack vector in `_handleSwapError`
let us look at this try catch block
```solidity
SwapUtils.SwapParams(
                params.contracts.dataStore,
                params.contracts.eventEmitter,
                params.contracts.oracle,
                Bank(payable(order.market())),
                params.key,
                result.outputToken,
                result.outputAmount,
                params.swapPathMarkets,
                0,
                order.receiver(),
                order.uiFeeReceiver(),
                order.shouldUnwrapNativeToken()
            )
        ) returns (address tokenOut, uint256 swapOutputAmount) {
            _validateOutputAmount(
                params.contracts.oracle,
                tokenOut,
                swapOutputAmount,
                order.minOutputAmount()
            );
        } catch (bytes memory reasonBytes) {
            (string memory reason, /* bool hasRevertMessage */) = ErrorUtils.getRevertMessage(reasonBytes);

            _handleSwapError(
                params.contracts.oracle,
                order,
                result,
                reason,
                reasonBytes
            );
        }
```
the problem exists in `_handleSwapError`
```solidity
function _handleSwapError(
        Oracle oracle,
        Order.Props memory order,
        DecreasePositionUtils.DecreasePositionResult memory result,
        string memory reason,
        bytes memory reasonBytes
    ) internal {
        emit SwapUtils.SwapReverted(reason, reasonBytes);

        _validateOutputAmount(
            oracle,
            result.outputToken,
            result.outputAmount,
            order.minOutputAmount()
        );

        MarketToken(payable(order.market())).transferOut(
            result.outputToken,
            order.receiver(),
            result.outputAmount,
            order.shouldUnwrapNativeToken()
        );
    }
}
```
`emit SwapUtils.SwapReverted(reason, reasonBytes);` because it emits this, the problem from the report above is still present in the protocol. let us look through the call flow to show how this can be pulled off.
```solidity
swapHandler.swap(
            SwapUtils.SwapParams(
                params.contracts.dataStore,
                params.contracts.eventEmitter,
                params.contracts.oracle,
                Bank(payable(order.market())),
                params.key,
                result.outputToken,
                result.outputAmount,
                params.swapPathMarkets,
                0,
                order.receiver(),
                order.uiFeeReceiver(),
                order.shouldUnwrapNativeToken()
            )
        )
```
the snippet above is called, this then calls
```solidity
contract SwapHandler is ReentrancyGuard, RoleModule {
    constructor(RoleStore _roleStore) RoleModule(_roleStore) {}

    /**
     * @dev perform a swap based on the given params
     * @param params SwapUtils.SwapParams
     * @return (outputToken, outputAmount)
     */
    function swap(
        SwapUtils.SwapParams memory params
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyController
        returns (address, uint256)
    {
        return SwapUtils.swap(params);
    }
}
```
then in swap utils
```solidity
   function swap(SwapParams memory params) external returns (address, uint256) {
        if (params.swapPathMarkets.length == 0) {
            if (params.amountIn < params.minOutputAmount) {
                revert Errors.InsufficientOutputAmount(params.amountIn, params.minOutputAmount);
            }

            if (address(params.bank) != params.receiver) {
                params.bank.transferOut(
                    params.tokenIn,
                    params.receiver,
                    params.amountIn,
                    params.shouldUnwrapNativeToken
                );
            }
```
if the receiver is a smart contract and shouldUnwrapNativeToken is false, the receiver can receive ETH and if it is a smart contract address, it can revert with long string and the protocol suffers from same issue.
## Impact
impact is the same from previous report
> A malicious user can use this attack in many different places, but they all stem from the bug in ErrorUtils.getRevertMessage(). One such attack would be that a user can prevent themselves from being liquidated or ADLed, by providing a malicious string in the revert reason in their [CallbackUtils.afterOrderExecution()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/OrderUtils.sol#L168) callback.
Other places include the freezing of orders, bypassing pauses by having resting orders that can never execute until allowed, and preventing orders from being canceled when their normal execution reverts.
