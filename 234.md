# Overflow protection adjustment in `getNextOpenInterestForVirtualInventory()` breaks accounting

## Summary

Overflow protection adjustment in `getNextOpenInterestForVirtualInventory()` attempts to reduce the magnitude of the OI, but does so in an unbalanced way


## Vulnerability Detail

In order to protect against overflow, `getNextOpenInterestForVirtualInventory()` removes `usdDelta` from both open interest values in order to equally adjust both sides. However, in order to make a proper adjustment, the ratios need to stay the same rather than just subtracting the same amount from both sides.

Modifying the [example](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/69#issuecomment-1498874702) from the previous contest, if long/short OI is `48/32` then the ratio is `1.5`. If the `offset` were, say, `5`, adding the offset to both sides would give `53/37` resulting in a ratio of `1.43`, which no longer matches `1.5`


## Impact

The adjustment is unequal, so price impact for virtual positions will be miscalculated, giving some users discounts they don't deserve, and others a penalty that they don't deserve, when placing orders.


## Code Snippet

A flat adjustment is applied to both sides:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/pricing/PositionPricingUtils.sol : PositionPricingUtils.getNextOpenInterestForVirtualInventory()   #1

322            // the virtual long and short open interest is adjusted by the usdDelta
323            // to prevent an overflow in getNextOpenInterestParams
324            // price impact depends on the change in USD balance, so offsetting both
325            // values equally should not change the price impact calculation
326            if (params.usdDelta < 0) {
327                uint256 offset = (-params.usdDelta).toUint256();
328 @>             longOpenInterest += offset;
329 @>             shortOpenInterest += offset;
330:           }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Multiply each side by the same fraction (e.g. `0.5`), and ensure the value after the multiplication is not zero if the original value wasn't zero
