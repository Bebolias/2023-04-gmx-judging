# user can bypass ui fee

## Summary
user can bypass the ui fee
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function getSwapFees(
        DataStore dataStore,
        address marketToken,
        uint256 amount,
        address uiFeeReceiver
    ) internal view returns (SwapFees memory) {
        SwapFees memory fees;

        uint256 feeFactor = dataStore.getUint(Keys.swapFeeFactorKey(marketToken));
        uint256 swapFeeReceiverFactor = dataStore.getUint(Keys.SWAP_FEE_RECEIVER_FACTOR);

        uint256 feeAmount = Precision.applyFactor(amount, feeFactor);

        fees.feeReceiverAmount = Precision.applyFactor(feeAmount, swapFeeReceiverFactor);
        fees.feeAmountForPool = feeAmount - fees.feeReceiverAmount;

        fees.uiFeeReceiver = uiFeeReceiver;
        fees.uiFeeReceiverFactor = MarketUtils.getUiFeeFactor(dataStore, uiFeeReceiver);
        fees.uiFeeAmount = Precision.applyFactor(amount, fees.uiFeeReceiverFactor);

        fees.amountAfterFees = amount - feeAmount - fees.uiFeeAmount;

        return fees;
    }
```
The uiFeeReceiver is fully in control of the user, user can always bypass the ui fee payment by selecting a not-set uiFeeReceiver
```solidity
fees.uiFeeReceiverFactor = MarketUtils.getUiFeeFactor(dataStore, uiFeeReceiver);
```
if the snippet above is 0
```solidity
fees.uiFeeAmount = Precision.applyFactor(amount, fees.uiFeeReceiverFactor);
```
and this is also 0
then the uiFeeAmount is always 0
user can always choose not to pay ui fee
the swapFeeReceiverFactor is hardcoded 
```solidity
uint256 swapFeeReceiverFactor = dataStore.getUint(Keys.SWAP_FEE_RECEIVER_FACTOR);
```
but the uiFeeReceiverFactor is based on uiFeeReceiver address, which can be arbitrarily set by user
## Impact
user can set the address of uiFeeReceiver so that he does not have to pay any ui fee.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
recommend to fix logic to ensure uifeereceiver can not be set arbitrarily by user
