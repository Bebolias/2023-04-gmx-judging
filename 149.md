# PositionUtils#willPositionCollateralBeSufficient() does not check remaining collateral is greater than  ``MIN_POSITION_SIZE_USD``, as a result, a Decrease Order might make a position immediately liquidable.

## Summary
``PositionUtils#willPositionCollateralBeSufficient()`` does not check remaining collateral is greater than  ``MIN_POSITION_SIZE_USD``, as a result, a Decrease Order might make a position immediately liquidable. The problem is that after a decrease order is executed, the remaining collateral might be smaller than ``MIN_POSITION_SIZE_USD``, but since ``PositionUtils#willPositionCollateralBeSufficient()``  does not check this, so the check will pass. However, ``PositionUtils.isPositionLiquidatable()`` will check the collateral amount against ``MIN_POSITION_SIZE_USD`` and decides that a position is liquidable. In summary, due to such inconsistent logic between these two similar functions, a trader might decrease position successfully but only made the position immediately liquidable, and thus might lead to chances to loss funds due to liquidation.

## Vulnerability Detail

First, during the execution of a decrease order, for example, the flow ``Orderhandler.executeOrder() -> _executeOrder() -> OrderUtils.executeOrder() -> processOrder() -> DecreaseOrderUtils.processOrder() -> DecreasePositionUtils.decreasePosition() -> positionUtils.WillPositionCollateralBeSufficient()``, one needs to check after realized Pnl and the withdrawal of intialCollateralDeltaAmount, whether the remaining collateral amount is sufficient.

Although it checks the remaining collateral amount against ``minCollateralUsdForLeverage``, it does not check against ``MIN_POSITION_SIZE_USD``. 

Meanwhile, ``isPositionLiquidable()`` will check the remaining collateral amount against  ``MIN_POSITION_SIZE_USD`` at L389-394 (shouldValidateMinCollateralUsd is always true during liquidation).

As a result, a trader might execute a decrease order successfully, but the resulting position might become immediately liquidable if the remaining collateral is smaller than ``MIN_POSITION_SIZE_USD``. 

## Impact
PositionUtils#willPositionCollateralBeSufficient() does not check remaining collateral is greater than  ``MIN_POSITION_SIZE_USD``, as a result, a Decrease Order might make a position immediately liquidable.
