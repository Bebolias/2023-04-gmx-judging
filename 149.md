# System design opens users to frontrunning risks

## Summary:Users could lose their funds to frontrunning.

## Vulnerability Detail:Solving frontrunning attacks was one of the key concept of the design  of the protocol while it is a great way to solve frontrunning attacks unfortunately it opens another doorway in the contract.
In the  contract ExchangeRouter.sol the function CreateDeposit which sole  purpose is used for adding liquidity to the pool .Documented in the Natspec says i quote “Deposit is created by transferring the specified tokens to the Deposit store and then calling the Deposit Handler contract”.This is a two step process, which requires depositing the tokens to the Deposit store and then calling  
createDeposit.Going further into the createDeposit function in  the DepositHandler,it doesn’t do much it just validates whether a feature is enabled assuming it is then uses a library to generate a key and store the Deposit.prop struct in DepositUtilstore.sol.Let see how amount of tokens are computed, the bug comes in the way added liquidity is computed it takes the difference between the last updated balance and the current balance . According to the spec createDeposit is a two step process which include sending tokens and how  the library calculates   amount of tokens deposited is the difference between the last updated balance and the current balance with respect to time the call is made, this could open risk to frontrunning users deposits .For example if Bob sees that alice made a deposit to the depositVault it would be easiest to frontrun alice by creating a deposit before alice and when his deposit is saved the balance is updated so that when alice’s transaction finally comes in since the amount is determined by the difference between last updated balance and current balance , if no deposits were made to the depositStore the difference would be zero and alice’s transaction would be reverted since it has a zero value, this could lead to very serious loss to the users and the protocol would lose clients and give the protocol a very bad reputation 

## Impact:Exploiting this vulnerability allows frontrunners to gain an unfair advantage over other users in the protocol. They can observe pending transactions, identify profitable opportunities, and execute their own transactions before the target transaction is processed. By doing so, they can  potentially gain economic benefits at the expense of other participants.
