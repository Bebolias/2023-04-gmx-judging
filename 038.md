# Unauthorized Token Minting in MarketToken Contract

## Summary
At [URL](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketToken.sol#L18)
This bug bounty report identifies a potential vulnerability in the `MarketToken` contract, specifically in the `mint` function. The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized minting of tokens by an attacker, potentially compromising the integrity of the token supply.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `MarketToken` contract uses the _`mint` function to `mint` tokens to a specified account. However, the `_mint` function does not include additional safety checks to prevent potential overflows or ensure the validity of the minting operation. This can create a security risk if the function is not properly guarded against unauthorized or excessive token minting. 

## Impact
If the `mint` function is exploited, an attacker could potentially `mint` an arbitrary amount of tokens to any account, including their own. This unauthorized minting could lead to an inflationary effect, devaluing the token and disrupting the intended token distribution mechanism. Additionally, it could compromise the market integrity and trust if the token supply is not accurately controlled and audited.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: BUSL-1.1

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "../bank/Bank.sol";

// @title MarketToken
// @dev The market token for a market, stores funds for the market and keeps track
// of the liquidity owners
contract MarketToken is ERC20, Bank {
    constructor(RoleStore _roleStore, DataStore _dataStore) ERC20("GMX Market", "GM") Bank(_roleStore, _dataStore) {
    }

    // @dev mint market tokens to an account
    // @param account the account to mint to
    // @param amount the amount of tokens to mint
    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyController {
        _mint(account, amount);
    }

    // @dev burn market tokens from an account
    // @param account the account to burn tokens for
    // @param amount the amount of tokens to burn
    function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyController {
        _burn(account, amount);
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the potential vulnerability, it is recommended to replace the `_mint` function with `_safemint` provided by the OpenZeppelin library. The `_safemint` function includes additional safety checks to prevent overflows and ensure the validity of the minting operation. By using `_safemint`, the contract will have enhanced protection against unauthorized or excessive token minting.

Additionally, it is advisable to thoroughly test the contract's minting functionality and ensure that it is only accessible by authorized accounts with proper access controls in place. Regular audits and security checks should be conducted to detect and address any potential vulnerabilities in the token minting process.
