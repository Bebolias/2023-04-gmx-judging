# Missing validation on latestRoundData

## Summary
The latestRoundData in _getPriceFeedPrice function is missing validation that returned data is not stale.

## Vulnerability Detail
In Oracle.sol, particularly the _getPriceFeedPrice function, latestRoundData is missing validation that the returned data is not stale

## Impact
If there is a problem with the oracle starting a new round or finding consensus on the new value for the oracle, consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale or incorrect date. 

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add checks like: require(updateTime != 0, "Incomplete round"); require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");
