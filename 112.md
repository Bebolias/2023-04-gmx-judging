# [H] [05-22 18:59] GMX v2 is not paying the `executionFee` to the keepers in case Liquidations/Adl order.

## Summary
[this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/OrderUtils.sol#L178) comment says 
```solidity
 // the order.executionFee for liquidation / adl orders is zero
//gas costs for liquidations / adl is subsidised by the treasury
```

## Vulnerability Detail
in case `Liquidations/Adl` order the `executionFee` value is zero.
The [payExecutionFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/gas/GasUtils.sol#L46-L80) is not sending any `gas costs` to the keepers if order ie `Liquidations/Adl` on-chain

```solidity
    function payExecutionFee(
        DataStore dataStore,
        EventEmitter eventEmitter,
        StrictBank bank,
        uint256 executionFee,
        uint256 startingGas,
        address keeper,
        address user
    ) external {
        uint256 gasUsed = startingGas - gasleft();
        uint256 executionFeeForKeeper = adjustGasUsage(dataStore, gasUsed) * tx.gasprice;

        if (executionFeeForKeeper > executionFee) {
            executionFeeForKeeper = executionFee;
        }

        bank.transferOutNativeToken(
            keeper,
            executionFeeForKeeper
        );

        emitKeeperExecutionFee(eventEmitter, keeper, executionFeeForKeeper);

        uint256 refundFeeAmount = executionFee - executionFeeForKeeper;
        if (refundFeeAmount == 0) {
            return;
        }

        bank.transferOutNativeToken(
            user,
            refundFeeAmount
        );

        emitExecutionFeeRefund(eventEmitter, user, refundFeeAmount);
    }
```
Also,  if you will pay them off-chain. the keeper is not granted to get paid. keepers will not trust an off-chain payment. so they will go to find a better opportunity and this could leave GMX V2 in a bad state.

## Impact
- `payExecutionFee()` isn't paying the `executionFee` in case `Liquidations/Adl` order. 
- GMX v2 probably won't be able to Liquidate unhealthy positions on the right time. 
- the Adl or auto-deleverages of GMX v2 will not be accurate.

## Recommendation
Add a logic to send the `gas costs`  to the keepers in case `Liquidations/Adl` order.
