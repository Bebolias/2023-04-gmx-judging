# MarketFactory can create a market with identical long and short tokens

## Summary

In the current implementation of the `createMarket` function in the MarketFactory contract, it is possible to create a market with identical long and short tokens. This can lead to unexpected behavior and confusion for users interacting with such markets.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `createMarket` function, there is no check to ensure that `longToken` and `shortToken` are different. This oversight allows the creation of a market with identical long and short tokens.

## Impact

This vulnerability may lead to unexpected behavior for users interacting with markets that have identical long and short tokens. It could also result in confusion and potential loss of funds due to misunderstandings.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check in the `createMarket` function to ensure that `longToken` and `shortToken` are not identical:

```solidity
require(longToken != shortToken, "Long and short tokens must be different");
```
