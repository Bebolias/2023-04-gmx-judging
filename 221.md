# Outdated prices can be used to execute orders while chain reorg occurs

## Summary
````oracle._setPrices()```` takes ````blockHash```` of ````minOracleBlockNumber````,  rather than ````maxOracleBlockNumber````, to verify price signatures. Outdated prices might be used to execute orders while chain reorg occurs.

```solidity
File: contracts\oracle\Oracle.sol
409:     function _setPrices(
410:         DataStore dataStore,
411:         EventEmitter eventEmitter,
412:         address[] memory signers,
413:         OracleUtils.SetPricesParams memory params
414:     ) internal {
...
447:             if (Chain.currentBlockNumber() - reportInfo.minOracleBlockNumber <= cache.minBlockConfirmations) {
448:                 reportInfo.blockHash = Chain.getBlockHash(reportInfo.minOracleBlockNumber);
449:             }
...
561:     }

```

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say oracle keepers sign a price with
```solidity
minOracleBlockNumber =  100
maxOracleBlockNumber = 101
oracleBlockHash = hashOfBlock100 = 0x100...
oracleTimestamp = timestampOfBlock100 = timestampOfBlock101 = 1000
token = ETH
price = 2000
...
signature = 0x111...111
```

But chain reorg occurs at height 101, the new block 101 with
```solidity
 timestampOfBlock101 = 1100
```
and the the market price of ETH at timestamp 1100 becomes 2200.

We can find that the above signature still be valid to execute orders in the new block 101, as the new ````hashOfBlock101```` is not checked and ````timestampOfBlock101```` is still in allowed ````maxPriceAge```` which might be set to 1 hour:
```solidity
File: contracts\oracle\Oracle.sol
437:             if (reportInfo.oracleTimestamp + cache.maxPriceAge < Chain.currentTimestamp()) {
438:                 revert Errors.MaxPriceAgeExceeded(reportInfo.oracleTimestamp);
439:             }

File: config\oracle.ts
72:     avalancheFuji: {
...
74:       maxOraclePriceAge: 60 * 60,
...
90:     },

```

## Impact
Users might suffer unexpected loss while their orders are executed at outdated prices.

## Recommendation 
check  ````blockHash```` of ````maxOracleBlockNumber````.
