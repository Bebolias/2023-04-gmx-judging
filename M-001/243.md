# MIN_ORACLE_SIGNERS may cause users to get liquidated, or get the wrong price

## Summary

Things that cause archive keepers to go offline can cause market orders to be unexecutable, and limit orders to get the wrong price


## Vulnerability Detail

If an archive oracle keeper is offline (e.g. due to a DOS or an infrastructure outage), it's expected to sign the block it sees when it comes back up, rather than the block range of its outage. Consider the case of a low-liquidity token, where there are only a few keepers interested in tracking its price. Assume further that most happen to be running on AWS in the same region, and AWS has an outage that triggers a restart of all VMs in that region. There will be no archive oracle prices for that duration for those keepers, and for the couple that _weren't_ running on AWS, their prices can't be used because [MIN_ORACLE_SIGNERS](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/oracle/Oracle.sol#L211-L213) isn't satisfied for that block range.




## Impact

Since market orders are required to be executed with prices from block ranges containing the order block number, and there won't be enough oracle signers, the user's order will not be executable. If the order was submitted in order to prevent a liquidation, the user will end up being liquidated anyway.

Market orders [can't be updated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/OrderHandler.sol#L85-L87) and have a delay before they can be [canceled](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/OrderHandler.sol#L130-L136), so even if the user notices there's a problem, their capital is locked in the order vault and their position will remain stuck.

Limit orders have a similar issue, except that since they're allowed to execute using the price from any block after the order, those orders will get the wrong price.


## Code Snippet

Market orders for increases require the min/max blocks to straddle the order block:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/IncreaseOrderUtils.sol : IncreaseOrderUtils.validateOracleBlockNumbers()   #1

81         function validateOracleBlockNumbers(
82             uint256[] memory minOracleBlockNumbers,
83             uint256[] memory maxOracleBlockNumbers,
84             Order.OrderType orderType,
85             uint256 orderUpdatedAtBlock
86         ) internal pure {
87  @>         if (orderType == Order.OrderType.MarketIncrease) {
88                 OracleUtils.validateBlockNumberWithinRange(
89                     minOracleBlockNumbers,
90                     maxOracleBlockNumbers,
91                     orderUpdatedAtBlock
92                 );
93                 return;
94:            }
```

The same is true for [decreases](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/DecreaseOrderUtils.sol#L132-L139) and [swaps](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/SwapOrderUtils.sol#L57-L64).

If there aren't enough signers, the keeper operation is rejected during the setting of oracle prices, which means the order isn't canceled or frozen - just that it remains unexecutable:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/oracle/Oracle.sol : Oracle.setPrices()   #2

211            if (signers.length < dataStore.getUint(Keys.MIN_ORACLE_SIGNERS)) {
212                revert Errors.MinOracleSigners(signers.length, dataStore.getUint(Keys.MIN_ORACLE_SIGNERS));
213:           }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Rather than leaving the order unexecutable when there aren't enough signers, execute it anyway but send the resulting funds to a holding area for the trade to be reviewed
