# LP withdrawal does not split impact pool; which is unfair for the risk they take

## Summary
LP withdrawal does not split impact pool; which is unfair for the risk they take

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider a market that is systematically on an unbalanced open interest; and the negative price impact factor is bigger than the positive impact price factor, resulting in constant inflow of revenue on impact price pool. However the price impact currently works like a simulated slippage, but the pool is only reserved for traders who would come in and make positive price impact. The liquidity provider is unable to touch it. 

In the above market structures, the slippage(s) might be a major part of incomes, and should be divisible among LP.

## Impact
LP withdrawal does not split impact pool; which is unfair for the risk they take especially when price impact pool grows.

## Recommendation
Consider a pro-rate split of any positive balance of impact pool when an LP withdraws.
