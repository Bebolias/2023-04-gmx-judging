# Lack of compatibility with two-address/multi-address tokens leads to an inflated pool value and wrong MarketToken minting calculations

## Summary
Tokens with different addresses sharing the same storage leads to miscalculations within key functionality inside MarketUtils.sol
## Vulnerability Detail
Inside MarketUtils.sol, to calculate the total amount of tokens in a pool the following function ```getPoolAmount``` is called. As the comments in the function explain, the ```getPoolDivisor``` function is called to prevent double token counting if longToken and shortToken are the same. 
```solidity
    function getPoolAmount(DataStore dataStore, Market.Props memory market, address token) internal view returns (uint256) {
        /* Market.Props memory market = MarketStoreUtils.get(dataStore, marketAddress); */
        // if the longToken and shortToken are the same, return half of the token amount, so that
        // calculations of pool value, etc would be correct
        uint256 divisor = getPoolDivisor(market.longToken, market.shortToken);
        return dataStore.getUint(Keys.poolAmountKey(market.marketToken, token)) / divisor;
    }
```
The ```getPoolDivisor``` function simply checks if the addresses of longToken and shortToken are equal. If the addresses are equal, then they are the same token and the amount of tokens will be halved to take into account the token supply being counted twice. If they aren't equal the assumption is that they are different tokens. This assumption can be broken by multi-address tokens
```solidity
    function getPoolDivisor(address longToken, address shortToken) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        return longToken == shortToken ? 2 : 1;
    }
```
Multi-address tokens such as SNX, have entry points pertaining both to the proxy contract and the main contract. These contracts have different addresses while both sharing the same storage and user balances. 
0xd0dA9cBeA9C3852C5d63A95F9ABCC4f6eA0F9032 and 0xC011a73ee8576Fb46F5E1c5751cA3B9Fe0af2a6F are two valid SNX addresses that have access to the same storage data, implementation code, and user balances
## Impact
This bug leads to a double counting of pool Tokens. The correct value is important in determining the pools actual value
```solidity
    function getPoolValueInfo(
        DataStore dataStore,
        Market.Props memory market,
        Price.Props memory indexTokenPrice,
        Price.Props memory longTokenPrice,
        Price.Props memory shortTokenPrice,
        bytes32 pnlFactorType,
        bool maximize
    ) public view returns (MarketPoolValueInfo.Props memory) {
        MarketPoolValueInfo.Props memory result;

        //@audit both these values will be double counted
        result.longTokenAmount = getPoolAmount(dataStore, market, market.longToken);
        result.shortTokenAmount = getPoolAmount(dataStore, market, market.shortToken);
        
        //@audit which leads to an overestimation in pool worth by a factor of 2x
        result.longTokenUsd = result.longTokenAmount * longTokenPrice.pickPrice(maximize);
        result.shortTokenUsd = result.shortTokenAmount * shortTokenPrice.pickPrice(maximize);

        uint256 poolValue = result.longTokenUsd + result.shortTokenUsd;
        //...
```
The pool value is used in multiple places including ```ExecuteDepositUtils._executeDeposit``` where its used to determine how  many MarketToken's to mint. 
```solidity
    function _executeDeposit(ExecuteDepositParams memory params, _ExecuteDepositParams memory _params) internal returns (uint256) {

       //..
        //@audit get the inflated pool value here
        MarketPoolValueInfo.Props memory poolValueInfo = MarketUtils.getPoolValueInfo(
        //..
        );

        uint256 poolValue = poolValueInfo.poolValue.toUint256();


        //...
        //@audit calculate marketToken amount using the inflated pool value
        mintAmount += MarketUtils.usdToMarketTokenAmount(
            fees.amountAfterFees * _params.tokenInPrice.min,
            poolValue,
            marketTokensSupply
        );

        //..
        //@audit mint the receiver an inflated amount of market token shares
        MarketToken(payable(_params.market.marketToken)).mint(_params.receiver, mintAmount);

        return mintAmount;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In this case it's difficult to provide an efficient catch-all code solution to this issue. Inside ```getPoolDivisor``` you could validate that longToken and shortToken balances/totalSupply are not the same since in practice its highly unlikely that two seperate tokens will have the same balance.  Though, since tokens are required to be whitelisted, I think it's enough for the whitelister to be aware of this case and disallow it along with rebasing and fee-on-transfer tokens. Though these tokens are rather uncommon, it has rather severe implications on the pools functionality and I believe is a medium severity issue.
