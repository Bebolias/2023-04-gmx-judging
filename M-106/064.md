# MarketUtils#validatePoolAmount() might not calculate the pool amount for a token correctly when ``market.longToken == market.shortToken``, as a result, the validation might be wrong.

## Summary
MarketUtils#validatePoolAmount() might not calculate the pool amount for a token correctly when ``market.longToken == market.shortToken``, as a result, the validation might be wrong. The main problem is that ``getPoolAmount(dataStore, market, token)`` will return only half of the amount (due to adjustment of divisor) when ``market.longToken == market.shortToken``.

## Vulnerability Detail
``MarketUtils#validatePoolAmount()``  is used to validate whether the amount of a given token exceeds ``maxPoolAmount`` for a given market. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1242-L1253](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1242-L1253)

However, ``getPoolAmount(dataStore, market, token)`` will only return half of the amount when ``market.longToken == market.shortToken``:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L482-L488](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L482-L488)

This is so because of the adjustment of the divisor: 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1571-L1573](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1571-L1573)

As a result, when when ``market.longToken == market.shortToken``, the total amount of a token will returned as half of the amount (divisor = 2). Therefore, the validation is wrong in this case.

## Impact
MarketUtils#validatePoolAmount() might not calculate the pool amount for a token correctly when ``market.longToken == market.shortToken``, as a result, the validation might be wrong.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Readjust the total amount when ``market.longToken == market.shortToken``, in this way, the correct amount is checked. 

```diff
function validatePoolAmount(
        DataStore dataStore,
        Market.Props memory market,
        address token
    ) internal view {
        uint256 poolAmount = getPoolAmount(dataStore, market, token);

+     if(market.longToken == market.shortToken) poolAmount = poolAmount * 2;

        uint256 maxPoolAmount = getMaxPoolAmount(dataStore, market.marketToken, token);

        if (poolAmount > maxPoolAmount) {
            revert Errors.MaxPoolAmountExceeded(poolAmount, maxPoolAmount);
        }
    }
```
