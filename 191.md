# XDZIBEC-Predictable salt in MarketFactory contract.

## Summary

The `MarketFactory` contract generates a `salt` for each `new market`, the `salt` is not generated `randomly`. This means that an attacker could predict the `salt` for a new market, it's could create a new market with the same `salt` as an `existing` market. This would allow the attacker to `steal` funds from the `existing` market by calling the `withdraw` function in the `Market contract`.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function createMarket(
        address indexToken,
        address longToken,
        address shortToken,
        bytes32 marketType
    ) external onlyMarketKeeper returns (Market.Props memory) {
        bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encode(
            "GMX_MARKET",
            indexToken,
            longToken,
            shortToken,
            marketType
        ));
```
there is a vulnerability in the` createMarket` function, this line `bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encode( ` generates a salt for the new marketr, the salt is not generated randomly. This means that an attacker could predict the salt for a new market. This would allow the attacker to create a new market with the same salt as an existing market. This would allow the attacker to steal funds from the existing market by calling the withdraw function in the Market contract.

## Impact

-an attacker to steal funds from the existing market by calling the `withdraw` function in the `Market` contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

-generate the salt randomly. it recommended do this by using the `keccak256` function with a random number, that to generate a random salt for each new market. This will prevent an attacker from predicting the salt for a new market. This will protect the funds in the existing markets from being `stolen` by the attacker.
