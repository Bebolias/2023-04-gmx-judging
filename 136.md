# Enforce Order cancelation even with feature disabled

## Summary
Attacker is able to cancel orders even with the feature of cancelling orders being disabled.


## Vulnerability Detail
Feature validation usually happens in all the handler contracts. In this case, `OrderHandler` is validating that the feature to cancel orders is not disabled when calling `cancelOrder`.

You can actually enforce an order cancelation even with the disabled feature

by the keeper calling `executeOrder` and the execution failing with any of these reasons:

```solidity
 isMarketOrder ||
            errorSelector == Errors.InvalidPositionMarket.selector ||
            errorSelector == Errors.InvalidCollateralTokenForMarket.selector ||
            errorSelector == Errors.InvalidPositionSizeValues.selector
```

## Impact
Bypass the circuit breaker from GMX by making `executeOrder` purposely to call `cancelOrder` even with that feature disabled.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I would advise to either reenforce the feature validation on the utils contracts apart from the handlers, or add a check on the error validating the feature.
