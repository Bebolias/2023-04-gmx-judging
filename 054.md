# Contract Existence Check Missing in multicall Function

## Summary
At [LINE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/utils/BasicMulticall.sol#L18)
The `multicall` function in the provided code does not include a contract existence check before making the `delegatecall`. This can potentially lead to gas wastage, unexpected failures, and lack of error handling if the target contract does not exist.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `multicall` function allows executing a batch of function calls on the contract using `delegatecall`. However, it does not include a check to verify the existence of the target contract before making the `delegatecall`. This means that if the target contract does not exist, the `delegatecall` will fail and consume all the gas allocated for the transaction.

## Impact
The absence of a contract existence check in the `multicall` function can have the following impacts:

Gas Wastage: When the `delegatecall` fails due to the target contract not existing, it consumes all the gas allocated for the transaction. This leads to wasted gas and potentially higher transaction costs.

Unexpected Failure: The failed `delegatecall` raises an exception, causing the transaction to revert. This can result in unexpected behavior, especially if there are other operations or state changes dependent on the success of the `multicall` function.

Lack of Error Handling: Without a contract existence check, the `multicall` function does not provide explicit error handling for the case where the target contract does not exist. This can make it harder to identify the root cause of the failure and provide meaningful error messages to users or other parts of the application.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function multicall(bytes[] calldata data) external virtual returns (bytes[] memory results) {
    results = new bytes[](data.length);

    for (uint256 i; i < data.length; i++) {
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);

        if (!success) {
            ErrorUtils.revertWithParsedMessage(result);
        }

        results[i] = result;
    }

    return results;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the risks associated with the missing contract existence check, it is recommended to include a check before the `delegatecall` to verify the existence of the target contract. This will help prevent gas wastage, provide better error handling, and avoid unexpected failures.

Here's an example of how the code can be modified to include a contract existence check:
```solidity
function multicall(address target, bytes[] calldata data) external virtual returns (bytes[] memory results) {
    require(target.exists(), "Contract does not exist");
    results = new bytes[](data.length);

    for (uint256 i; i < data.length; i++) {
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.delegatecall(data[i]);

        if (!success) {
            ErrorUtils.revertWithParsedMessage(result);
        }

        results[i] = result;
    }

    return results;
}
```

By adding the `target.exists()` check before making the `delegatecall`, the code ensures that the target contract exists before attempting the function calls. This provides better error handling and prevents gas wastage.
