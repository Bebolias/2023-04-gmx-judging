# Limit Swap orders are still delayed by a block

## Summary

The fix for issue https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/160 has been applied to increase and decrease limit orders but not to swap limit orders.

## Vulnerability Detail

As can be seen here: 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/SwapOrderUtils.sol#L58

There is still a delay of 1 block 

## Impact

Limit Swap orders that could be triggered at the price when they were created would not be able to be executed and can be executed at a much less profitable size a block later.
