# Unnecessary oracle block number restrictions for limit swap orders

## Summary

Currently, the code unnecessarily requires that oracle price block numbers come after the block where the limit swap order was placed, to ensure that primary and secondary prices are not prices from before the order was placed.

## Vulnerability Detail

Both secondary and primary price are required to come after the order block for limit swap orders. This is currently achieved inside `SwapOrderUtils.validateOracleBlockNumbers` on line 67:

## Impact

Users can be affected by undesirable order execution.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Primary/secondary prices should not be unnecessarily restricted, resulting in an undesirable order execution, and instead should be allowed to equal the order block:

```solidity
// SwapOrderUtils.sol
67            if (!minOracleBlockNumbers.areGreaterThanOrEqualTo(orderUpdatedAtBlock)) {
```
