# User can have healthy position even at Zero collateral

## Summary
A user can end up with a position with zero collateral and still having a big positive position size. This will grant the user risk-free trades with infinite leverage.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ```values.remainingCollateralAmount``` variable in ```processCollateral``` function of ```DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.sol``` tracks the remaining collateral and is decreased one by one for pnl amount, initialCollateralAmount and fees. If the value at end is < 0 then it reverts with an error ```InsufficientCollateral```. 

But a user can send a decrease order with an initial collateral delta such that ```values.remainingCollateralAmount``` becomes 0 at the end so it will not revert and the liquidation checks later via ```validatePosition``` will succeed if the user maintains a positive enough profit (that balances the ```remainingCollateralUsd``` calculation in ```isPositionLiquidatable)```. Thus user will now have zero collateral(excluding PnL) , some previous profits and a big possible position size. Using this position he can trade risk-free.

## Impact
This will hold the open interest but there will be no corresponding collateral. This may impact the ability of the pool to pay funding fees if multiple users increase Open Interest this way. Since the Open Interest is now manipulated, it manipulates all calculations : borrowingFees , PnL etc. for all users

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change ```if (values.remainingCollateralAmount < 0) { revert Errors.InsufficientCollateral(values.remainingCollateralAmount); }```   to   ```if (values.remainingCollateralAmount <= 0) { revert Errors.InsufficientCollateral(values.remainingCollateralAmount); }```
