# The Holding_address in TokenUtils has no way of retreiving funds

## Summary
In transfer function of ```TokenUtils.sol```, when transfer fails the funds are instead sent to a ```holdingAddress``` but there is no way to retrieve back these funds for the user.

## Vulnerability Detail
A token transfer can fail for a wide variety of reasons like token contract paused, insufficient gas(since we are using raw call) or because some tokens do not revert when there is insufficient balance. For all these cases, a holding address is designated, for which the comment says, "for holding tokens that could not be sent out". This means this address is supposed to be a holder of tokens, but there is no clarity on how will users gets those funds back.
Even if this address is assumed to be an EOA, there is no internal accounting logic here to count for who owes what amount of failed tokens to whom. The address will just become a cumulative balance of different tokens with no user able to call those funds back.

## Impact
A lot of ERC20 transfers can fail without reverting and this can leave large amounts of tokens stuck in the Holding address. The transfer function is a staple part of all user operations so these stuck funds can grow a lot.

```solidity
function transfer(
        DataStore dataStore,
        address token,
        address receiver,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        if (amount == 0) { return; }
        AccountUtils.validateReceiver(receiver);

        uint256 gasLimit = dataStore.getUint(Keys.tokenTransferGasLimit(token));
        if (gasLimit == 0) {
            revert Errors.EmptyTokenTranferGasLimit(token);
        }

        (bool success0, /* bytes memory returndata */) = nonRevertingTransferWithGasLimit(
            IERC20(token),
            receiver,
            amount,
            gasLimit
        );

        if (success0) { return; }

        address holdingAddress = dataStore.getAddress(Keys.HOLDING_ADDRESS);

        if (holdingAddress == address(0)) {
            revert Errors.EmptyHoldingAddress();
        }

        (bool success1, bytes memory returndata) = nonRevertingTransferWithGasLimit(
            IERC20(token),
            holdingAddress,
            amount,
            gasLimit
        );
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add some internal accounting logic in this place to record all failed token transfer amounts, and clarify if the Holding Address will be a contract with a function to retrieve these funds back.
