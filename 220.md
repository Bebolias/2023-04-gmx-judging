# there is no max/min requirement on the newly added heartbeat variable PRICE_FEED_HEARTBEAT_DURATION

## Summary
there is no max/min requirement on the newly added heartbeat variable PRICE_FEED_HEARTBEAT_DURATION 
## Vulnerability Detail
a new variable PRICE_FEED_HEARTBEAT_DURATION is added to ensure a staleness check on the chainlink price feed. However there is no min/max enforcement on this variable. It is possible to pause all price related transaction by setting this variable to 0,  which means no price would be "fresh" except the intra-block transaction. Or essentially remove this check when setting the heartbeat to `type(uint256).max`.This is very frictional since there are many places where the protocol has implemented min/max on configuration like all the FeeFactors, for trust minimisation.

The fix is as follow:
```solidity
        uint256 heartbeatDuration = dataStore.getUint(Keys.priceFeedHeartbeatDurationKey(token));
        if (block.timestamp > timestamp && block.timestamp - timestamp > heartbeatDuration) {
            revert Errors.PriceFeedNotUpdated(token, timestamp, heartbeatDuration);
        }
```

## Impact
reduce the trust minimisation that the protocol has made an effort to create through enforcing a range on system configuration.
