# No minimum threshold for timelock delay can result in a malicious TimelockAdmin gaining full control over the protocol

## Summary
The timelockDelay set inside ```config/Timelock.sol``` has no minimum value which can cause the entire timelock functionality to be bypassed by a malicious admin.

## Vulnerability Detail
The timelock is used for setting key protocol features such as role and oracle/token pricing information. A malicious/mistaken deployer can simply initiate the timelock delay to 0 seconds which would cause proposals to be validated instantly. 
```solidity
    constructor(
        RoleStore _roleStore,
        DataStore _dataStore,
        EventEmitter _eventEmitter,
        OracleStore _oracleStore,
        uint256 _timelockDelay
    ) RoleModule(_roleStore) {
        dataStore = _dataStore;
        eventEmitter = _eventEmitter;
        oracleStore = _oracleStore;
        timelockDelay = _timelockDelay;
    }
```

## Impact
If the timelock delay was initialized to 0 seconds then protocol users would not have enough time to react to malicious protocol changes and could be rug-pulled. Additionally, the TimelockAdmin would be able to take full control of the protocol by revoking all privileges, multisig or not, and installing himself as the sole arbiter. Although unlikely, since all roles are considered ```RESTRICTED```, I believe this is a valid medium severity issue since the ramifications are extremely drastic.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a minimum timelock delay of 24-48 hours would be ideal
