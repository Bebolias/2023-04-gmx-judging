# pnlDiffAmount was sent to the order maker instead of a holding area, as a result, the trader is not penalized for the porition of ``pnlDiffAmount``.

## Summary
``pnlDiffAmount`` was sent to the order maker instead of a holding area, as a result, the trader is not penalized for the porition of ``pnlDiffAmount``. 


## Vulnerability Detail
``pnlDiffAmount`` is the difference between the positonPnlAmount and the capped minimal ``positionaPnlAmount``. This is the penalty that is paid by the trader due to negative Pnl impact (more imbalance). 

Suppose an order keeper executes  a MarketIncrease order and consider the flow ``OrderHandler.executeOrder() -> _executeOrder() -> OrderUtils.executeOrder() -> processOrder() -> DecreaseOrderUtils.processOrder() -> DecreasePositionUtils.decreasePosition() -> DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.processCollateral()``, in particular function   ``DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.processCollateral()``.

``pnlDiffAmount`` , which is calculated below should have paid by the trader, and should have sent to a holding area (see comments as well in the code), but by mistake, it was sent back to the ``params.order.receiver()``. This means, the order maker does not pay this penalty of ``pnlDiffAmount`` at all as it is refunded.

## Impact

``pnlDiffAmount`` was sent to the order maker instead of a holding area, as a result, the trader is not penalized for the porition of ``pnlDiffAmount``.
