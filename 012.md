# Unbounded loop in validateOracleBlockNumbers

## Summary

In the `SwapOrderUtils.sol` contract, the `validateOracleBlockNumbers` function can lead to an unbounded loop, depending on the input provided. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause high gas consumption or make the function fail due to exceeding the gas limit.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability occurs in the `validateOracleBlockNumbers` function, specifically when calling the `areGreaterThan` function from the `Array` library. This function loops through the provided array, which can be of arbitrary length, and compares each element to a given value.

## Impact

An attacker can provide a large array for `minOracleBlockNumbers`, which would result in high gas consumption and potentially make the `validateOracleBlockNumbers` function fail due to exceeding the gas limit. This can be used to disrupt the contract's normal operation and, in some cases, may even lock funds or halt specific functionalities.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, introduce a limitation on the maximum length of the `minOracleBlockNumbers` array. This can be done by adding a `require` statement to check the array's length before calling the `areGreaterThan` function. The limit should be set to a reasonable value to prevent excessive gas consumption and potential attacks.

```solidity
require(minOracleBlockNumbers.length <= MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH, "Array length exceeds allowed maximum");
```

In addition, the `areGreaterThan` function should be reviewed and modified as necessary to ensure safe and efficient execution. Consider implementing a break condition to stop the loop once the desired outcome has been reached or an invalid value has been encountered.
