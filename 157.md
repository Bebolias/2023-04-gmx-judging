# Steal any ether in exchange router

## Summary
You can steal any ether that is in the exchange router contract

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `exchange router contract` they are sending `wnt` by first depositing ether and calling the library `tokenUtils`

The problem is that it is not enforced that the actual msg.value is sent with the call. 

Any user can just pass amount as any value is in the router contract and it be substracted from its balance, stealing the ether from it because the library does not enforce a msg.value neither, it just takes the funds from the contract.

## Impact
Steal the entire ether balance from the contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check such as:

```solidity
 function sendWnt(address receiver, uint256 amount) external payable nonReentrant { 
     AccountUtils.validateReceiver(receiver); 
     require(msg.value == amount, "wrong");
     TokenUtils.depositAndSendWrappedNativeToken(dataStore, receiver, amount); 
 } 

```
