# Swap path is validated twice when it should only be once

## Summary
The swap path is limited to 5 swaps, but the logic allows for 10 swap paths
## Vulnerability Detail
This issue arises from the fix to the bug in the previous contests below
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/54
The protocol adds logic which ensures that only 5 swaps are possible, you can see that fix below aswell.
```solidity
    function validateSwapPath(DataStore dataStore, address[] memory swapPath) internal view returns (Market.Props[] memory) {
        uint256 maxSwapPathLength = dataStore.getUint(Keys.MAX_SWAP_PATH_LENGTH);
        if (swapPath.length > maxSwapPathLength) {
            revert Errors.MaxSwapPathLengthExceeded(swapPath.length, maxSwapPathLength);
        }

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < swapPath.length; i++) {
            address marketAddress = swapPath[i];
            validateEnabledMarket(dataStore, marketAddress);
        }
    }
```
the swap will revert if `swapPath.length` is greater than `maxSwapPathLength`, which is 5. the problem here is that the logic allows for 5 swaps twice, therefore the length of the swap path is actually 10 instead of the 5 that the protocol intended. This occurs in the snippet below 
```solidity
MarketUtils.validateSwapPath(dataStore, params.longTokenSwapPath);
MarketUtils.validateSwapPath(dataStore, params.shortTokenSwapPath);
```
for example, when creating order, if the max swap path is 5, then order 5 swap path is allowed, but in deposit you have 5 swaps and 
in withdraw you also have 5 swaps, therefore a 10 swap path is allowed.
## Impact
The fix that was meant for the issue 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/54
is not sufficient and the attacker can execute txs with stale prices by inputting a very extense swapPath.
The attack would allow to make free trades in terms of risk. You can trade without any risk by conttroling when to execute the transaction

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
we recommend to ensure the max swap is actually 5 as intended.
