# [H] [05-25 08:12] `StopLossDecrease` are broken when there are price gaps

## Summary
The fix of the issue [140](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/140) on the last contest, reveals a similar bug but this time with `Order.OrderType.StopLossDecrease`

## Vulnerability Detail
On this [block](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/BaseOrderUtils.sol#L278-L286)
```solidity
            bool ok = shouldValidateAscendingPrice ?
                (primaryPrice <= triggerPrice && triggerPrice <= secondaryPrice) : // so  PrimaryPrice =< SecondaryPrice
                (primaryPrice >= triggerPrice && triggerPrice >= secondaryPrice);  // so  PrimaryPrice >= SecondaryPrice

            if (!ok) {
                revert Errors.InvalidStopLossOrderPrices(primaryPrice, secondaryPrice, triggerPrice, shouldValidateAscendingPrice);
            }
```
in case of a long position,
`triggerPrice == $4990`,
`primaryPrice == $4980` 
and `SecondaryPrice == $4970`

so `shouldValidateAscendingPrice == false`
and this check `(primaryPrice >= triggerPrice && triggerPrice >= secondaryPrice)` should be true to execute the `StopLossDecrease` order.

But in our case, it will revert which conflicts with the concept of `StopLossDecrease` order also docs say  
```diff
Long position example: if the current index token price is $5000, 
a stop-loss decrease order can be created with acceptable price as $4990,
 the order can be executed when the index token price is <= $4990.
```
## Impact
The execution of the order will be reversed. leaving the user exposed to their position, even if they had a valid stop-loss set

## Recommendation
Add an additional check to make sure `triggerPrice` is a valid price
