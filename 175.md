# XDZIBEC-vulnerability in BaseOrderHandler Contract Allows Potential Denial-of-Service Attacks

## Summary
There is a vulnerability in `BaseOrderHandler` contract it's lead to DOS attacks, this vulnerability  arises from the discrepancy between the expected parameter `type` and the `returned` value in the `MarketUtils.getEnabledMarket` functiont, so If the `params.order.market(`) function returns a `bytes32` value instead of an `address`, the `MarketUtils.getEnabledMarket` function may return `null` when an enabled market address is `expected`, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability  by deliberately passing an invalid `params.order.market()` value could cause the` _getExecuteOrderParams` function to `fail`, potentially opening the door to various security risks.
## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function _getExecuteOrderParams(
        bytes32 key,
        OracleUtils.SetPricesParams memory oracleParams,
        address keeper,
        uint256 startingGas
    ) internal view returns (BaseOrderUtils.ExecuteOrderParams memory) {
        BaseOrderUtils.ExecuteOrderParams memory params;

        params.key = key;
        params.order = OrderStoreUtils.get(dataStore, key);
        params.swapPathMarkets = MarketUtils.getEnabledMarkets(
            dataStore,
            params.order.swapPath()
        );
```
the vulnerability in the `_getExecuteOrderParams` function, so the `params.order.market()` function returns a `bytes32` value, but the `MarketUtils.getEnabledMarke`t function expects an `address` value, this will cause the function to `fail` if the order's market is not `enabled`, Consequently, the` _getExecuteOrderParams` function will `fail`, potentially disrupting the normal operation of the contract.

## Impact

-An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the `_getExecuteOrderParams` function to fail, which would prevent users from being able to execute orders. This could lead to a `denial-of-service` attack on the platform.
-if an attacker exploit this vulnerability can leading to theft of funds or the manipulation of data.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

-Cast the` bytes32` value to an address value before calling the `MarketUtils.getEnabledMarket` function, this will ensure that the `MarketUtils.getEnabledMarket` function always receives a valid address value.
-add additional validation to the `_getExecuteOrderParams` function to ensure that the `params.order.market()` value is actually the address of an enabled market. This will prevent an attacker from exploiting the bug by sending a transaction to the `_getExecuteOrderParams` function with a `params.order.market()` value that is not the address of an enabled market.
