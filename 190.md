# XDZIBEC-Insufficient execution fee check does not check for zero value

## Summary

There is a vulnerability in the` validateExecutionFee` function. The vulnerability is relates to the `absence` of error handling or a `revert` statement when the execution fee is insufficient, an attacker could create a transaction with an execution fee of zero. When this transaction is executed, the `validateExecutionFee` function will not `revert`, and the attacker will be able to execute the `transaction` for free.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
 function validateExecutionFee(DataStore dataStore, uint256 estimatedGasLimit, uint256 executionFee) internal view {
        uint256 gasLimit = adjustGasLimitForEstimate(dataStore, estimatedGasLimit);
        uint256 minExecutionFee = gasLimit * tx.gasprice;
        if (executionFee < minExecutionFee) {
            revert Errors.InsufficientExecutionFee(minExecutionFee, executionFee);
        }
    }
```

The vulnerability is in the `validateExecutionFee` function, the error  that it does not check to see if the `executionFee` is `greater` than `zero`. This means that an attacker could create a transaction with an execution fee of zero. When this transaction is executed, the `validateExecutionFee` function will not revert, and the attacker will be able to execute the transaction for free.


## Impact

-An attacker could execute transactions for free if exploit the vulnerability, this could be done by creating a transaction with an execution fee of zero. When this transaction is executed, the `validateExecutionFee` function will not revert, and the attacker will be able to execute the transaction for free.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

-added to the `validateExecutionFee` function to code it's will check to see if the `executionFee` is greater than zero. If it is not, the `validateExecutionFee` function will revert, and the attacker will not be able to execute the transaction for free.
