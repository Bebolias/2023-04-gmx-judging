# XDZIBEC-Current governor can set pendingGov to any address

## Summary

The `transferOwnership` function in the `Governable` contract allows the current `governor` to set the `pendingGov` variable to any address. This is vulnerability can allows the current `governor` to effectively `transfer` `ownership` of the contract to any address they want.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address _newGov) external onlyGov {
        pendingGov = _newGov;
    }

    function acceptOwnership() external {
        if (msg.sender != pendingGov) {
            revert Errors.Unauthorized(msg.sender, "PendingGov");
        }

        _setGov(msg.sender);
    }

    // @dev updates the gov value to the input _gov value
    // @param _gov the value to update to
```


-The `transferOwnership` function is only accessible to the current `governor`. This means that the current `governor` can set the `pendingGov` variable to any address, even if the address is not `authorized` to be the `governor`. This means that the current `governor` can effectively `transfer` ownership of the contract to any address they want. so it  should make the `transferOwnership` function accessible to only the `gov` variable, to prevent the current `governor` from setting the pendingGov variable to any address.

## Impact

-If an attacker exploit this vulnerability it's can  allows the current `governor `to effectively `transfer ownership `of the `contract `to any `address` they want.

## Recommendation

-the `transferOwnership` function should  be accessible to only the `gov` variable. This will prevent the current `governor` from `setting` the `pendingGov` variable to any address they want.
