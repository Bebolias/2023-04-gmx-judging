# Not updating `updatedAtBlock`  when freezing orders

## Summary
Order block is not updated when being frozen.

## Vulnerability Detail
When an order is updated/created it is trigger a call to `order.touch(); ` to update the `updatedAtBlock` variable. This is doen to validate and verify whether the order is still in range to be executed. 

When you are freezing an order, you are updating it:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/OrderUtils.sol#L287-L289

but, it misses to update the `updatedAtBlock ` variable to account for when it is updated

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L104-L108

failing to do this will cause frozen order is some cases to fall outside the range of block numbers by not being updated.

## Impact

Frozen orders are not updated which might cause them to fall outside the valid range to be executed
