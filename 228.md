# `transfer` in `TokenUtils` can drain funds and prevent execution/cancelation if arbitrary/compromised token is used

## Summary

The `transfer` in `TokenUtils` has multiple limits of gas consumption to validate that gas will not be drained and operations can be canceled if needed. This is not true if arbitrary tokens will be supported by the GMX platform OR a legitimate token that is upgradable (LIKE USDC) is compromised and updated.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability is similar to previous issue https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/118 where a crafted revert message can drain the gas of the transaction due to incorrect bytes length and memory expansion when decoding the revert reason.

When a transfer fails in `transfer`, a new transfer to a holding address is performed using `nonRevertingTransferWithGasLimit`. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/token/TokenUtils.sol#L77

`nonRevertingTransferWithGasLimit` will return the returndata of the failed transaction back to `transfer`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/token/TokenUtils.sol#L215

The returndata will be sent to `ErrorUtils.getRevertMessage` which has the vulnerability mention in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/118.

`getRevertMessage` incorrectly shifts the `bytes memory` length that allows the callee to revert with a very large offset pointer that will cause a gas consuming memory expansion during `MLOAD` in `abi.decode`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/error/ErrorUtils.sol#L19
```solidity
    function getRevertMessage(bytes memory result) internal pure returns (string memory, bool) {
        // If the result length is less than 68, then the transaction either panicked or failed silently
        if (result.length < 68) {
            return ("", false);
        }

        bytes4 errorSelector = getErrorSelectorFromData(result);

        // 0x08c379a0 is the selector for Error(string)
        // referenced from https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/
        if (errorSelector == bytes4(0x08c379a0)) {
            assembly {
                result := add(result, 0x04)
            }

            return (abi.decode(result, (string)), true);
        }

        // error may be a custom error, return an empty string for this case
        return ("", false);
    }
```

An example of a malicious revert reason would look like this:
```solidity
        assembly{
            let free_mem_ptr := mload(64)
            mstore(free_mem_ptr, 0x08c379a000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
            mstore(add(free_mem_ptr, 4), 0xfffffff) // This will cause an out of gas on MLOAD
            mstore(add(free_mem_ptr, 36), 8)
            mstore(add(free_mem_ptr, 68), "deadbeef")
            revert(free_mem_ptr, 100)
        }
```

## Impact

Operations such as deposits can be stuck without being able to execute or cancel them (due to out of gas). Keepers gas will be drained and users will not receive any funds back

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When parsing the revert reason, validate the offsets are smaller then the length of the encoding.
