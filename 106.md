# Wrong formula to calculate the Borrowing Fees

## Summary
Wrong formula used to calculate the borrowing fees

## Vulnerability Detail

In the docs it is clearly stated that the formula used to calculate the price impact is:

```solidity

There is a borrowing fee paid to liquidity providers, this helps prevent users from opening both long and short positions to take up pool capacity without paying any fees.

Borrowing fees are calculated as `borrowing factor * (open interest in usd + pending pnl) ^ (borrowing exponent factor) / (pool usd)` for longs and `borrowing factor * (open interest in usd) ^ (borrowing exponent factor) / (pool usd)` for shorts.
```
though there is nowhere in the codebase used, the actual formula to calculate the borrowing fees is different to the stated on the docs.

## Impact
The formula is wrong implemented according to the docs, which might cause a wrong calculation of the borrowing fees.
