# MarketUtils#getNextTotalBorrowing() calculates the new totalBorrwoing incorrectly.

## Summary
``MarketUtils#getNextTotalBorrowing()`` calculates the new totalBorrwoing incorrectly. The main problem is that it charges the borrowing fee to a new borrowing principal immediately. As a result, the totalBorrowing is calculated larger than it is supposed to be.


## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the flow ``OrderHandler.executeOrder() -> _executeOrder() -> OrderUtils.executeOrder() -> processOrder() -> IncreaseOrderUtils.processOrder() -> increasePositionUtils.increasePosition()``.

One of the tasks to increase a position is update the new total borrowing by calling  ``PositionUtils.updateTotalBorrowing() -> MarketUtils.updateTotalBorrowing() -> getNextTotalBorrowing()``.
``getNextTotalBorrowing()`` is used to calculate the new ``totalBorrowing`` for the ``isLong`` side based on:  1) ``prevPositionSizeInUsd``,  2)  ``prevPositionBorrowingFactor``, 3)  ``nextPositionSizeInUsd``, and 4)  ``nextPositionBorrowingFactor``:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1930-L1945](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1930-L1945)

However, the above implementation will apply ``nextPositionBorrowingFactor`` to ``nextPositionSizeInUsd`` immediately, meaning that new borrowing principal will be charged with a borrowing fee immediately. This is not right. The correct formula should be: 

```javascript
new totalBorrowing = old TotalBorrowing - prevPositionSizeInUsd + nextPositoinSizeInUsd
                                   + prevPositionSizeInUsd*(nextPositionBorrowingFactor-prevPositionBorrowingFactor)/Precision.FLOAT_PRECISION
```


## Impact
MarketUtils#getNextTotalBorrowing() calculates the new totalBorrwoing incorrectly. The main problem is that it charges fees to new borrowing immediately.  Incorrect internal accounting such as totalBorrowing will lead to loss of funds.

## Recommendation
Calcualte the new total weight with both the change of principal and the accurud borrowing fee ONLY for the past pincipal, not new principal. 

```diff
    function getNextTotalBorrowing(
        DataStore dataStore,
        address market,
        bool isLong,
        uint256 prevPositionSizeInUsd,
        uint256 prevPositionBorrowingFactor,
        uint256 nextPositionSizeInUsd,
        uint256 nextPositionBorrowingFactor
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 totalBorrowing = getTotalBorrowing(dataStore, market, isLong);
        // divide by Precision.FLOAT_PRECISION to reduce the risk of overflow
-        totalBorrowing -= prevPositionSizeInUsd * prevPositionBorrowingFactor / -Precision.FLOAT_PRECISION;
-        totalBorrowing += nextPositionSizeInUsd * nextPositionBorrowingFactor / -Precision.FLOAT_PRECISION;
+          uint256 interest =prevPositionSizeInUsd * (nextPositionBorrowingFactor-prevPositionBorrowingFactor)/Precision.FLOAT_PRECISION;
+      totalBorrowing = totalBorrowing - prevPositionSizeInUsd + nextPositionSizeInUsd;
+      totalBorrowing = totalBorrowing + interest;

        return totalBorrowing;
    }
```
