# IncreasePositionUtils.getPositionFees() does not account for who pays for the fees.referral.traderDiscountAmount.

## Summary
``IncreasePositionUtils.getPositionFees()`` does not account for who pays for the ``fees.referral.traderDiscountAmount``. While it is nice for a trader to receive discount for the collateral cost, the money should come from where category, one cannot just simply subtract a number. However, the code does not show where it is coming from, leading to mis-accounting problem. The system might break when this loophole blows up. 

## Vulnerability Detail
``IncreasePositionUtils.getPositionFees()`` is used  for each trade to calculate the trade cost, which splits into different receivers.

There might be a discount for the trader as see below:

It does not account for where funds for ``fees.referral.traderDiscountAmount`` will come from.  
It does not reduce the amount of fees for other categories either. For example, let's say the discount is for ``positionFeeAmount``, then it is imporant to make sure ``fees.referral.traderDiscountAmount <= positionFeeAmount`` so that ``fees.referral.traderDiscountAmount`` will not exceed what can be paid. The contract does not seem to reduce the amounts for ``fundingFeeAmount``,           ``fees.borrowing.borrowingFeeAmount`` and ``fees.ui.uiFeeAmount`` either - which means, none of those categories will actually pay this discount.

For example: suppose collateralDeltaAmount = 100, that is the trader sends this much of collateral. Let's say positionFeeAmount = 4, fundingFeeAmount = 4 borrowingFeeAmount =  3, uiFeeAmount =2, and  traderDiscountAmount = 5. So collateralDeltaAmount = 4+4+3+2 - 5 = 8. Therefore, new  collateralDeltaAmount = 100-8 = 92. The trader will deposit 92 after the cost. However, all the costs are still claimable in the original amount without discounts in current implementation: positionFeeAmount = 4, fundingFeeAmount = 4 borrowingFeeAmount =  3, uiFeeAmount =2. That is none of them will be reduced. As a result, there is a mis-accouing discrepancy of the 5 for the discount. By the way, in this example, none of the category of fees can cover this 5 discount to illustrate some of the points we like to make below. 


The correct way to do this is: make sure one or two categories  will pay for this discount, so it is important to  subtract the discount from those categories first (make sure there is no underflow), so that fees that can be claimed under those categories will be reduced (effectively they are the ones who pay for the discount).  

In summary, nobody paid for ``fees.referral.traderDiscountAmount``, this number is simply subtracted from the cost. This is a mis-accounting problem. When this blows up, the system might run into a serious problem one day.

## Recommendation
Make sure one or two categories  will pay for this discount, so it is important to  subtract the discount from those categories (make sure there is no underflow), so that fees that can be claimed under those categories will be reduced (effectively they are the ones who pay for the discount).
