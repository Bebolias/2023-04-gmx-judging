# AdlHandler.executeAdl() can be used to auto-deleverage arbitrary position that is on the isLong side.

## Summary
``executeAdl()`` can be used to auto-deleverage arbitrary position that is on the isLong side even though the PNL/openInterest is low for that position. 

## Vulnerability Detail
AdlHandler.executeAdl() can be used can be used to auto-deleverage a position if the position is on a side whose PNL is too high: 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/AdlHandler.sol#L89-L164](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/AdlHandler.sol#L89-L164)

The problem is that the choice of which position to ADL is sort of arbitrary, as long as it brings down pnlToPoolFactor without overcorrection, the execution will go though. As a result, a position that has a very low positive PNL/open interest (maybe was recently opened) might become the target for ADL, subject to other punishment such as position fee, price impact fee, etc.  It might cause loss (due to position fee) who otherwise have the opportunity to gain profit.  

Another threshold should be introduced which evaluates the individual position PNL/open interest ratio, only when this ratio is greater than the given threshold, the position can become a candidate for a ADL. In this way, on one hand, ADL can achieve its best effectiveness, on the other hand, the marginal positions will not be ADLed and incur loss as a result.



## Impact

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
AdlHandler.executeAdl() can be used to auto-deleverage arbitrary position that is on the isLong side. If the position is only on marginal profit, such ADL will lead to their loss of funds due to position cost.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Pick the positions that have high PnL/open interests for ADL only.
