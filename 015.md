# Possible Integer Overflows and Underflows

## Summary

Order.sol does not include checks to prevent integer overflows or underflows.

## Vulnerability Detail

Functions such as `setSizeDeltaUsd`, `setInitialCollateralDeltaAmount`, and `setMinOutputAmount` accept uint256 values as input but do not check for potential overflows or underflows.

## Impact

An attacker might cause integer overflows or underflows, which could result in unexpected behavior or financial losses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the OpenZeppelin SafeMath library or built-in Solidity functions for arithmetic operations to prevent integer overflows and underflows. Ensure that input values are within valid ranges before performing arithmetic operations.
