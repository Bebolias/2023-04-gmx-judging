# Missing Access Control and Validation on Function Calls

## Summary

Order.sol lacks proper access control and input validation mechanisms for its internal functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

Internal functions, such as `setUiFeeReceiver`, `setOrderType`, and `setSwapPath`, modify critical parameters of the order. However, these functions do not have any access control mechanisms or input validation checks to prevent unauthorized or invalid inputs.

## Impact

An attacker may exploit this vulnerability to manipulate or disrupt the contract's intended behavior, potentially causing financial loss or enabling other attacks.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement appropriate access control mechanisms (e.g., using `modifier`s) and input validation checks (e.g., require statements) to ensure that only authorized users can call these functions and provide valid inputs.
