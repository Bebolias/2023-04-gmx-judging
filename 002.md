# Unprotected 'receive' function

## Summary

The 'receive' function is not protected by any access control mechanism and allows arbitrary users to send native tokens to the Bank contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The 'receive' function checks if the sender is not the wrapped native token (WNT) address but does not prevent other arbitrary addresses from sending native tokens to the contract. This could lead to unintentional deposits and potential loss of funds.

## Impact
Users can unintentionally send native tokens to the Bank contract, which may result in loss of funds or unexpected behavior.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Introduce an access control mechanism to allow only authorized addresses to send native tokens to the Bank contract or implement a mechanism to return unexpected deposits.
