# XDZIBEC-Request Cancellation Truncation Vulnerability

## Summary

There is a vulnerability in  `validateRequestCancellation` function in the `ExchangeUtils` library  that could allow an attacker to cancel requests before the specified expiration period has passed. in  fact that the` requestExpirationAge` variable is declared as a `uint` value, but the `dataStore.getUint(Keys.REQUEST_EXPIRATION_BLOCK_AGE)` function returns a `uint256` value. This means that the value returned by the `dataStore.getUint(Keys.REQUEST_EXPIRATION_BLOCK_AGE)` function will be truncated to `256 bits`, which could lead to an incorrect value being used to validate the request cancellation.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function validateRequestCancellation(
        DataStore dataStore,
        uint256 createdAtBlock,
        string memory requestType
    ) internal view {
        uint256 requestExpirationAge = dataStore.getUint(Keys.REQUEST_EXPIRATION_BLOCK_AGE);
        uint256 requestAge = Chain.currentBlockNumber() - createdAtBlock;
        if (requestAge < requestExpirationAge) {
            revert Errors.RequestNotYetCancellable(requestAge, requestExpirationAge, requestType);
        }
    }
}
```
the validateRequestCancellation function is vulnerable to DOS attack or incorrect request handling,
By providing a` createdAtBlock` value that is greater than the current block number, the subtraction operation `Chain.currentBlockNumber() `- `createdAtBlock` will result in an `integer` underflow. This could cause the `requestAge` variable to have a very large value instead of the actual elapsed blocks, potentially exceeding the` requestExpirationAge.` and also if   the calculated `requestAge` mistakenly appears greater than the `requestExpirationAge`, the function may allow the cancellation of a `request` that should still be valid. This could lead to premature cancellation of important operations or transactions and also it's allows an attacker to repeatedly trigger the `validateRequestCancellation` function with incorrect` createdAtBlock` values, it could lead to excessive computation and resource exhaustion, resulting in a DoS attack. This could impact the availability and performance of the system

## Impact

-An attacker could exploit the bug to cause the `validateRequestCancellation` function to fail, which would prevent users from being able to cancel requests. This could lead to a denial-of-service attack on the platform.
-The vulnerability could also be exploited to cause  the theft of funds or the manipulation of data.

## Recommendation

-Change the type of the `requestExpirationAge` variable to `uint64`
