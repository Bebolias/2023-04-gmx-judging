# `heartbeatDuration` is calculated with the `block.timestamp` instead `currentTimestamp()`

## Summary
In `Oracle.sol` we have function `_getPriceFeedPrice` in which `heartbeatDuration` is calculated but with wrong `timestamp`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's look at how the `heartbeatDuration`  is calculated:

```solidity
608: uint256 heartbeatDuration = dataStore.getUint(Keys.priceFeedHeartbeatDurationKey(token)); 
609:         if (block.timestamp > timestamp && block.timestamp - timestamp > heartbeatDuration) {
610:             revert Errors.PriceFeedNotUpdated(token, timestamp, heartbeatDuration);
611:        }
```

We can see that `block.timestamp` is used for the calculation but this is wrong. 
Everywhere in the project to get the current `block.timestamp` is used the function `Chain.currentTimestamp()`. 

Тhis change to the use of `currentTimestamp()` was made when the change for `Chain.currentBlockNumber(`) should have also been made:
