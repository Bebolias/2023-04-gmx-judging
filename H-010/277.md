# Logical error when computing `estimatedRemainingCollateralUsd`

## Summary

```solidity
                estimatedRemainingCollateralUsd += params.order.initialCollateralDeltaAmount().toInt256();
                params.order.setInitialCollateralDeltaAmount(0);
```

here, collateral amount is not multiplied with the price of collateral when incrementing `estimatedRemainingCollateralUsd`. It assumes price to be 1 USD (without precision) for any given collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

`initialCollateralDelta` is the user input token which may or may not be stablecoin, so the worth of it should be evaluated with respect to its price which is not currently happening.

## Impact

It will lead to ambiguous processing of position's collateral and might give lot of profit to user or liquidate them depending on the actual price of collateral.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Multiply with collateral token price with proper precision and added test-cases where collateral token is non USDC
