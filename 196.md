# GasUtils.payExecutionFee should not be external

## Summary

GasUtils.payExecutionFee should not be external if not anyone can call the function directly and misappropriate funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The payExecutionFee function is used to pay keepers for doing their job, like executing deposits or withdrawal. Even if the deposit/withdraw fails, the keeper still has to be paid. 

```solidity
File: gmx-synthetics\contracts\gas\GasUtils.sol
46:     function payExecutionFee(
47:         DataStore dataStore,
48:         EventEmitter eventEmitter,
49:         StrictBank bank,
50:         uint256 executionFee,
51:         uint256 startingGas,
52:         address keeper,
53:         address user
54:@>   ) external {
55:         uint256 gasUsed = startingGas - gasleft();
56:         uint256 executionFeeForKeeper = adjustGasUsage(dataStore, gasUsed) * tx.gasprice;
57: 
58:         if (executionFeeForKeeper > executionFee) {
59:             executionFeeForKeeper = executionFee;
60:         }
61: 
62:         bank.transferOutNativeToken(
63:             keeper,
64:             executionFeeForKeeper
65:         );
66: 
67:         emitKeeperExecutionFee(eventEmitter, keeper, executionFeeForKeeper);
68: 
69:         uint256 refundFeeAmount = executionFee - executionFeeForKeeper;
70:         if (refundFeeAmount == 0) {
71:             return;
72:         }
73: 
74:         bank.transferOutNativeToken(
75:             user,
76:             refundFeeAmount
77:         );
78: 
79:         emitExecutionFeeRefund(eventEmitter, user, refundFeeAmount);
80:     }

```

This function is marked as external and has no modifier restriction, meaning that anybody can call the function and set an arbitrary amount of executionFee and address to game the system. This situation is unlike any other functions in GasUtils, where their function visibility is set to internal, meaning that the function can only be called internally within the contract or by the contracts inherited from the current one.

```solidity
Internal functions:

File: gmx-synthetics\contracts\gas\GasUtils.sol
86:     function validateExecutionFee(DataStore dataStore, uint256 estimatedGasLimit, uint256 executionFee) internal view {

File: gmx-synthetics\contracts\gas\GasUtils.sol
97:     function adjustGasUsage(DataStore dataStore, uint256 gasUsed) internal view returns (uint256) {

```

## Impact

Users can call payExecutionFee pretending to be keepers and withdraw funds.

## Recommendation

Make the function internal instead like all the other functions in GasUtils.
