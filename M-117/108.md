# There is a double accounting problem for managing fundingAmountPerSize for each account.

## Summary
There is a double accounting problem for managing ``fundingAmountPerSize`` for each account. For each market, there are four ``fundingAmountPerSize`` numbers. Meanwhile, each position manages two  ``fundingAmountPerSize``  numbers. Since each account can have four positions based on long/short and the callateral tokens for the position. As a result, each account maintains up to eight  ``fundingAmountPerSize``  numbers. This is a double accouting of the total possible four ``fundingAmountPerSize`` numbers. The trader will either double pay for the penalty or receive double rewards. 

## Vulnerability Detail

First, we see, there are four ``fundingAmountPerSize`` numbers, which can be retrieved by ``MarketUtils.getFundingAmountPerSize()`` based on long/short position and long/short collateral tokens. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1752-L1754C6](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1752-L1754C6)

Meanwhile, each position manages two such numbers: 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/Position.sol#L38-L72](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/Position.sol#L38-L72)

Since each account can have 4 positions, then each account essentially manages up to 8 fundingAmountPerSize numbers.

1. Position 1: long collateral, long position, manages fundingAmountPerSize_LongCollateralLongPositon, fundingAmountPerSize_ShortCollateralLongPosition.

2. Position 2: short collateral, long position manages
fundingAmountPerSize_LongCollateralLongPositon, fundingAmountPerSize_ShortCollateralLongPosition.

3. Position 3: long collateral, short position, manages
fundingAmountPerSize_LongCollateralShortPositon, fundingAmountPerSize_ShortCollateralShortPosition.

4. Position 4: short collateral, short position, manages
fundingAmountPerSize_LongCollateralShortPositon, fundingAmountPerSize_ShortCollateralShortPosition.

Therefore, each fundingAmountPerSize is managed by two positions. That means, the fundingAmount, if is penalty, needs to be paid by the trader twice, and it is a reward, then will be paid to the trader twice also. The following code confirms such double reward/penalty. It is executed when both rewards/penalty have been processed. However, this will be done again in another position for the same account! Consider the flow ``OrderHandler.executeOrder() -> _executeOrder() -> OrderUtils.executeOrder() -> processOrder() -> IncreaseOrderUtils.processOrder() -> IncreasePositionUtils.increasePosition()`` during a limitIncreae Order execution and finally, two such fudningAmountPerSize numbers will be updated of both of them have been paid (or rewarded):

## Impact
There is a double accounting problem for managing ``fundingAmountPerSize`` for each account.  As a result, the trader will either double pay for the penalty or receive double rewards.

## Recommendation
Eliminate one of the numbers in the position props and avoid double accounting.
