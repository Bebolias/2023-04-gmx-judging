# XDZIBEC-Unused Parameter 'startingGas' in _executeDeposit Function Can Lead to Inefficient Gas Usage #L141

## Summary

The `_executeDeposit` function receives `startingGas` as a parameter, but it is not used within the function. Instead, it calculates the starting gas again using `gasleft().

## Vulnerability Detail

HERE is the line of code where the vulnerability is:
```solidity
function _executeDeposit(
        bytes32 key,
        OracleUtils.SetPricesParams memory oracleParams,
        address keeper
    ) external onlySelf {
        uint256 startingGas = gasleft();

```
he gas optimization vulnerability is caused by the use of a parameter that is not being used within the
`_executeDeposit` function. The `startingGas` parameter is passed into the function but is not utilized in any way. Instead, the function calculates the starting gas again using `gasleft()`.
This creates a vulnerability because an attacker could potentially manipulate the `startingGas` parameter to cause the function to fail. Additionally, the unnecessary use of `startingGas` parameter adds complexity to the code without any added benefit.
## Impact

it can lead to inefficient gas usage in the smart contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

 remove the `startingGas` parameter from the `_executeDeposit` function and use the calculated value directly. This will simplify the code and remove any potential vulnerabilities caused by unused parameters.
the gas optimization vulnerability is caused by unnecessary code complexity.
