# IncreasePositionUtils#increasePosition() might clear the funding amount incorrectly.

## Summary
``IncreasePositionUtils#increasePosition()`` might clear the funding amount incorrectly. The problem is when the position is flushed back to the store using ``PositionStoreUtils.set()``, both ``LongTokenFundingAmountPerSize`` and ``ShortTokenFundingAmountPerSize`` will be updated with the latest values. However, when the user needs to pay both the ``LongTokenFunding`` and ``ShortTokenFunding``, the transaction only paid one of them (corresponding to ``params.position.collateralToken()``), the other one has not been paid yet. As a result, the user ends up not paying for one of the fundings.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the flow ``orderHandler.executeOrder() -> _executeOrder() -> OrderUtils.executeOrder() -> processOrder() -> IncreaseOrderUtils.processOrder() -> InceasePositionUtils.increasePosition``, in particular the function ``InceasePositionUtils.increasePosition()``:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/IncreasePositionUtils.sol#L53-L209](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/IncreasePositionUtils.sol#L53-L209)

The function finally will flush the position back to the store using ``PositionStoreUtils.set()``, both ``LongTokenFundingAmountPerSize`` and ``ShortTokenFundingAmountPerSize`` will be updated with the latest values.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/IncreasePositionUtils.sol#L126-L136](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/IncreasePositionUtils.sol#L126-L136)

This means, the amount of funding a user needs to pay, both long and short tokens, must have been paid at this point. However, this is not the case, the user has only paid the funding for the side of ``params.position.collateralToken()``. The other side has not been paid yet! To see this, consider the function IncreasePositionUtils.processCollateral() which calculates the amount of fee a trader needs to pay, including the funding amount fee to pay: 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/IncreasePositionUtils.sol#L216-L279](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/IncreasePositionUtils.sol#L216-L279)

At L238, it calls ``PositionPricingUtils.getPositionFees()`` to calculate the position fees, including both claimable funding fee and debt funding fee:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/pricing/PositionPricingUtils.sol#L376-L438](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/pricing/PositionPricingUtils.sol#L376-L438)

In particular, funding fee is calculated in function  ``getFundingFees()``:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/pricing/PositionPricingUtils.sol#L455-L497](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/pricing/PositionPricingUtils.sol#L455-L497)

While claimable funding token amount is accounted for both long and short tokens, the ``fundingFeeAmount`` is ONLY accounted for ``position.collateralToken()`` (due to the condition in the two if-statements), NOT for ``getOppositeToken( position.collateralToken())``. In other words, only the debt funding for ``position.collateralToken()`` has been paid, the the debt funding for ``getOppositeToken( position.collateralToken())`` has not been paid yet. 

In summary, although the debt funding amount has only been paid for ``position.collateralToken()``, not for ``getOppositeToken( position.collateralToken())``, ``IncreasePositionUtils#increasePosition()`` will still bring the position with the latest values for both ``LongTokenFundingAmountPerSize`` and ``ShortTokenFundingAmountPerSize``, and thus clear out the debt funding for the trader on the side of ``getOppositeToken( position.collateralToken())``.

## Impact
IncreasePositionUtils#increasePosition() might clear the funding amount incorrectly, possibly clearing out the debt funding the trader owes on the side of ``getOppositeToken( position.collateralToken())``.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow the claimable balance (long or short) to be negative, which indicates a debt. Accrue funding, both long and short, into their respective claimable balances. 

 A user can only claim positive claimable balance, but when a user needs to increase a position, the claimable, if negative, needs to be offset to zero first as part of the position fee. 

Since both long and short funding amount, positive or negative, are all accounted. We can bring the position with the latest values for both ``LongTokenFundingAmountPerSize`` and ``ShortTokenFundingAmountPerSize`` safely now.
