# MarketUtils#validateSwapPath() fails to validate the swapPath is indeed valid.

## Summary
``MarketUtils#validateSwapPath()`` fails to validate the swapPath is indeed valid. A valid path requires that two neighboring markets must have one token in common. A valid path also requires that for the same market, the long token and short token must be different. 

## Vulnerability Detail
``MarketUtils#validateSwapPath()`` is used to validate whether a swap path is valid or not.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L2179-L2189](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L2179-L2189)

In its current implementation, it only checks the length of the path and whether each market is enabled on the path. However, for a path to be valid, we need to check two more requirements: 1) A valid path also requires that for the same market, the long token and short token must be different; 2) A valid path requires that two neighboring markets must have one token in common.


## Impact
MarketUtils#validateSwapPath() fails to validate the swapPath is indeed valid. Therefore, an invalid path might pass the validation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) Check that neighboring markets have one token in common and 2) check for each market along the path, the long and short tokens are different.
