# Un-refunded gas not used during callbacks

## Summary
Any gas not used during callbacks is un-refunded to the users, integrations.

## Vulnerability Detail
Any user or contract interacting with GMX will not exactly pass the right number in the callback gasLimit, because it is a too complex parameter to calculate for most people even developers. You can just check how any integration with uniswap is not able to calculate the `sqrt` value because it is too complex for most people.

Protocols that integrate with GMX usually will have a hardcoded callback gas limit value or they will fallback to the callback gas limit from gmx because it does not need any calculation. 

```solidity
  function afterWithdrawalExecution(bytes32 key, Withdrawal.Props memory withdrawal) internal {
        if (!isValidCallbackContract(withdrawal.callbackContract())) { return; }

        try IWithdrawalCallbackReceiver(withdrawal.callbackContract()).afterWithdrawalExecution{ gas: withdrawal.callbackGasLimit() }(key, withdrawal) {
        } catch {
            emit AfterWithdrawalExecutionError(key, withdrawal);
        }
    }
```

Currently according to the tests, gmx has a callback gas limit of 2M gas, which is insane for any protocol or user using a callback contract.

Regardless of what the callback contract uses of gas, all the gas forwarded is charged to the user, even if the callback spends almost no gas.

## Impact
Loss of funds for integrations or users using a callback contract by overpaying the gas they spend

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Calculate the gas that is actually spent on the callback contract call and calculate the difference with the gas before the call.

```solidity
 function afterWithdrawalExecution(bytes32 key, Withdrawal.Props memory withdrawal) internal returns(uint256 gasToRefund){
        if (!isValidCallbackContract(withdrawal.callbackContract())) { return; }
            uint256 gasBeforeCallback = gasleft();
        try IWithdrawalCallbackReceiver(withdrawal.callbackContract()).afterWithdrawalExecution{ gas: withdrawal.callbackGasLimit() }(key, withdrawal) {
            uint256 gasAfterCallback = gasleft();
            gasToRefund = gasBeforeCallback - gasAfterCallback;
        }catch {
            emit AfterWithdrawalExecutionError(key, withdrawal);
        }
    }
```
