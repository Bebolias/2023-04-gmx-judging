# Underestimated gas estimation for executing withdrawals leads to insufficient keeper compensation

## Summary
The GasUtils.estimateExecuteWithdrawalGasLimit function underestimates the gas estimation for withdrawal execution, as it does not take into account the param `shouldUnwrapNativeToken`, unlike the gas estimation in the GasUtils.estimateExecuteDepositGasLimit function (used to estimate executing deposits).

## Vulnerability Detail
When creating a withdrawal request, the WithdrawalUtils.createWithdrawal function estimates the gas required to execute the withdrawal and validates that the paid execution fee (params.executionFee) is sufficient to cover the estimated gas and to compensate the keeper executing the withdrawal fairly.

However, the GasUtils.estimateExecuteWithdrawalGasLimit function used to estimate the gas for executing withdrawals does not account for token swaps that can occur at the end of the withdrawal logic and therefore underestimates the gas estimation.

Token swaps are performed in the WithdrawalUtils._executeWithdrawal function in lines 354 and 365.

## Impact
The keeper executing withdrawals receives fewer execution fees and is not fully compensated for the gas spent. Moreover, users can pay fewer execution fees than expected and required.

## Recommendation
Consider incorporating the extra gas spent from unwrapping WETH in the gas estimation for withdrawal execution.
