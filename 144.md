# Keepers can be forced to waste gas with long revert messages even after fix

## Summary
keepers can be forced to waste gas with long revert messages even after the fix
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/141
this vulnerability stems from the report above. While the team has ultimately added a fix, the fix was not sufficient to stop this attack vector. Below i will demonstrate how this can still be done.

in WithdrawalHandler.sol 
```solidity
function executeWithdrawal(
        bytes32 key,
        OracleUtils.SetPricesParams calldata oracleParams
    )
        external
        globalNonReentrant
        onlyOrderKeeper
        withOraclePrices(oracle, dataStore, eventEmitter, oracleParams)
    {
        uint256 startingGas = gasleft();

        try this._executeWithdrawal(
            key,
            oracleParams,
            msg.sender
        ) {
        } catch (bytes memory reasonBytes) {
            _handleWithdrawalError(
                key,
                startingGas,
                reasonBytes
            );
        }
    }
```
when _executeWithdrawal failed, catch part will be executed with arbitrary long length string.
when we look at the _executeWithdrawal flow
```solidity
function _executeWithdrawal(
        bytes32 key,
        OracleUtils.SetPricesParams memory oracleParams,
        address keeper
    ) external onlySelf {
        uint256 startingGas = gasleft();

        FeatureUtils.validateFeature(dataStore, Keys.executeWithdrawalFeatureDisabledKey(address(this)));

        uint256[] memory minOracleBlockNumbers = OracleUtils.getUncompactedOracleBlockNumbers(
            oracleParams.compactedMinOracleBlockNumbers,
            oracleParams.tokens.length
        );

        uint256[] memory maxOracleBlockNumbers = OracleUtils.getUncompactedOracleBlockNumbers(
            oracleParams.compactedMaxOracleBlockNumbers,
            oracleParams.tokens.length
        );

        WithdrawalUtils.ExecuteWithdrawalParams memory params = WithdrawalUtils.ExecuteWithdrawalParams(
            dataStore,
            eventEmitter,
            withdrawalVault,
            oracle,
            key,
            minOracleBlockNumbers,
            maxOracleBlockNumbers,
            keeper,
            startingGas
        );

        WithdrawalUtils.executeWithdrawal(params);
    }
```
this calls
```solidity
function executeWithdrawal(ExecuteWithdrawalParams memory params) external {
        Withdrawal.Props memory withdrawal = WithdrawalStoreUtils.get(params.dataStore, params.key);
        if (withdrawal.account() == address(0)) {
            revert Errors.EmptyWithdrawal();
        }
        if (withdrawal.marketTokenAmount() == 0) {
            revert Errors.EmptyWithdrawalAmount();
        }

        OracleUtils.validateBlockNumberWithinRange(
            params.minOracleBlockNumbers,
            params.maxOracleBlockNumbers,
            withdrawal.updatedAtBlock()
        );

        uint256 marketTokensBalance = MarketToken(payable(withdrawal.market())).balanceOf(address(params.withdrawalVault));
        if (marketTokensBalance < withdrawal.marketTokenAmount()) {
            revert Errors.InsufficientMarketTokens(marketTokensBalance, withdrawal.marketTokenAmount());
        }

        _executeWithdrawal(params, withdrawal);

        WithdrawalEventUtils.emitWithdrawalExecuted(params.eventEmitter, params.key);

        CallbackUtils.afterWithdrawalExecution(params.key, withdrawal);

        GasUtils.payExecutionFee(
            params.dataStore,
            params.eventEmitter,
            params.withdrawalVault,
            withdrawal.executionFee(),
            params.startingGas,
            params.keeper,
            withdrawal.account()
        );
    }
```
the final execution is done by calling the `_executeWithdrawal(params, withdrawal);`
```solidity
function _executeWithdrawal(
        ExecuteWithdrawalParams memory params,
        Withdrawal.Props memory withdrawal
    ) internal {
        Market.Props memory market = MarketUtils.getEnabledMarket(params.dataStore, withdrawal.market());

        MarketUtils.MarketPrices memory prices = MarketUtils.getMarketPrices(
            params.oracle,
            market
        );

        ExecuteWithdrawalCache memory cache;

        (cache.longTokenOutputAmount, cache.shortTokenOutputAmount) = _getOutputAmounts(params, market, prices, withdrawal.marketTokenAmount());

        cache.longTokenFees = SwapPricingUtils.getSwapFees(
            params.dataStore,
            market.marketToken,
            cache.longTokenOutputAmount,
            withdrawal.uiFeeReceiver()
        );

        FeeUtils.incrementClaimableFeeAmount(
            params.dataStore,
            params.eventEmitter,
            market.marketToken,
            market.longToken,
            cache.longTokenFees.feeReceiverAmount,
            Keys.WITHDRAWAL_FEE
        );

        FeeUtils.incrementClaimableUiFeeAmount(
            params.dataStore,
            params.eventEmitter,
            withdrawal.uiFeeReceiver(),
            market.marketToken,
            market.longToken,
            cache.longTokenFees.uiFeeAmount,
            Keys.UI_WITHDRAWAL_FEE
        );

        cache.shortTokenFees = SwapPricingUtils.getSwapFees(
            params.dataStore,
            market.marketToken,
            cache.shortTokenOutputAmount,
            withdrawal.uiFeeReceiver()
        );


 ...................................

           swap(
            params,
            market,
            market.shortToken,
            cache.shortTokenOutputAmount,
            withdrawal.shortTokenSwapPath(),
            withdrawal.minShortTokenAmount(),
            withdrawal.receiver(),
            withdrawal.uiFeeReceiver(),
            withdrawal.shouldUnwrapNativeToken()
        );
```
inside swap the tokens are swapped and sent to the receiver
if shouldUnwrapNativeToken enabled,
```solidity
 function swap(SwapParams memory params) external returns (address, uint256) {
        if (params.swapPathMarkets.length == 0) {
            if (params.amountIn < params.minOutputAmount) {
                revert Errors.InsufficientOutputAmount(params.amountIn, params.minOutputAmount);
            }

            if (address(params.bank) != params.receiver) {
                params.bank.transferOut(
                    params.tokenIn,
                    params.receiver,
                    params.amountIn,
                    params.shouldUnwrapNativeToken
                );
            }

            return (params.tokenIn, params.amountIn);
        }
```
native token is unwrapped and sent to the receiver
```solidity
function transferOut(
        address token,
        address receiver,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyController {
        _transferOut(token, receiver, amount);
    }
``` 
this calls
```solidity
function _transferOut(
        address token,
        address receiver,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        if (receiver == address(this)) {
            revert Errors.SelfTransferNotSupported(receiver);
        }

        TokenUtils.transfer(dataStore, token, receiver, amount);

        _afterTransferOut(token);
    }
```
if the receiver iscontract address, it could have a fallback function which has custom logic that would revert with huge length string
when this happen, the catch part is executed in executeWithdrawal 
catch (bytes memory reasonBytes) 

```solidity
function _handleWithdrawalError(
        bytes32 key,
        uint256 startingGas,
        bytes memory reasonBytes
    ) internal {
        (string memory reason, /* bool hasRevertMessage */) = ErrorUtils.getRevertMessage(reasonBytes);

        bytes4 errorSelector = ErrorUtils.getErrorSelectorFromData(reasonBytes);

        if (
            OracleUtils.isOracleError(errorSelector) ||
            errorSelector == Errors.DisabledFeature.selector
        ) {

            ErrorUtils.revertWithCustomError(reasonBytes);
        }

        WithdrawalUtils.cancelWithdrawal(
            dataStore,
            eventEmitter,
            withdrawalVault,
            key,
            msg.sender,
            startingGas,
            reason,
            reasonBytes
        );
    }
```
reverting with arbitrary length execution will consume maximum amount of gas
the remaining gas will not be sufficient to complete the cancelWithdrawal
The issue can be maliciously crafted by any smart contract that would have custom logic to revert for quite some time till the keeper exhaust their funds
## Impact
the impact will be the same from previous report.
> Keepers can be forced to spend more gas than they expect to for all operations. If they don't have a reliable way of calculating how much gas is used, they'll have spent more gas than they get in return.
If all keepers are expected to be able to calculate gas fees, then an attacker can submit an order whose happy path execution doesn't revert, but whose failure path reverts with a long string, which would essentially prevent the order from being executed until a more favorable price is reached. The user could, for example, submit an order with a long revert string in the frozen order callback, which would prevent the order from being frozen, and would allow them to [game the price impact](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/OrderHandler.sol#L256-L261)
