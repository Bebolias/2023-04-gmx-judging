# User-supplied slippage for decrease orders is ignored

## Summary
user supplied slippage control is ignored
## Vulnerability Detail
This issue stems from a previous bug found in gmx
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/138
this report details There are no checks that the amount out matches the user-supplied value during order creation, and in fact infinite slippage is allowed during the swap of PNL and collateral, ensuring there are opportunities for sandwiching.
The team have deployed a fix that is ineffective
```solidity
 function _validateOutputAmount(
        Oracle oracle,
        address outputToken,
        uint256 outputAmount,
        uint256 minOutputAmount
    ) internal view {
        // for limit / stop-loss orders, the latest price may be the triggerPrice of the order
        // it is possible that the valuation of the token using this price may not be precise
        // and the condition for the order execution to revert may not be accurate
        // this could cause orders to be frozen even if they could be executed, and orders
        // to be executed even if the received amount of tokens is less than what the user
        // expected
        // the user should be informed of this possibility through documentation
        // it is likely preferred that decrease orders are still executed if the trigger price
        // is reached and the acceptable price is fulfillable
        uint256 outputTokenPrice = oracle.getLatestPrice(outputToken).min;
        uint256 outputUsd = outputAmount * outputTokenPrice;

        if (outputUsd < minOutputAmount) {
            revert Errors.InsufficientOutputAmount(outputUsd, minOutputAmount);
        }
    }
``` 
the above logic does not enforce that slippage is not 0. Using an oracle is not sufficient check to ensure that slippage beyond a users input is passed. Slippage amount is still set to 0
## Impact
User's orders will have swap impacts applied to them during swaps, resulting in the user getting less than they asked for. This is a direct loss of funds for the user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend to add logic that enforces slippage control.
