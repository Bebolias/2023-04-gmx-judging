# Users cannot seamlessly migrate from other platforms to GMX

## Summary
The current implementation lacks support for ````StopEntryIncrease```` order type. Stop-entry order is a widely used tool, especially by professional traders and trading bots. The absence may cause users hard to migrate their trading strategies from other platforms to GMX.

```solidity
File: contracts\order\Order.sol
12:     enum OrderType {
13:         // @dev for LimitIncrease, LimitDecrease, StopLossDecrease orders, two prices for the
14:         // index token need to be recorded in the oracle
15:         // the price with the smaller block number is stored as the primary price while the price with the
16:         // larger block number is stored as the secondary price
17:         // the triggerPrice must be validated to be between the primary price and secondary price
18:         // LimitDecrease and StopLossDecrease are reduce-only orders
19: 
20:         // @dev MarketSwap: swap token A to token B at the current market price
21:         // the order will be cancelled if the minOutputAmount cannot be fulfilled
22:         MarketSwap,
23:         // @dev LimitSwap: swap token A to token B if the minOutputAmount can be fulfilled
24:         LimitSwap,
25:         // @dev MarketIncrease: increase position at the current market price
26:         // the order will be cancelled if the position cannot be increased at the acceptablePrice
27:         MarketIncrease,
28:         // @dev LimitIncrease: increase position if the triggerPrice is reached and the acceptablePrice can be fulfilled
29:         LimitIncrease,
30:         // @dev MarketDecrease: decrease position at the current market price
31:         // the order will be cancelled if the position cannot be decreased at the acceptablePrice
32:         MarketDecrease,
33:         // @dev LimitDecrease: decrease position if the triggerPrice is reached and the acceptablePrice can be fulfilled
34:         LimitDecrease,
35:         // @dev StopLossDecrease: decrease position if the triggerPrice is reached and the acceptablePrice can be fulfilled
36:         StopLossDecrease,
37:         // @dev Liquidation: allows liquidation of positions if the criteria for liquidation are met
38:         Liquidation
39:     }

```

## Vulnerability Detail
A stop-entry order is used to get into the market in the direction that it's currently moving. For example, let's say you have no position, but you observe that ETH/USD has been moving in a sideways range between $1900 and $2000, and you believe it will ultimately move higher.

In this case, you could place a stop-entry order above the current range high of $2000—say at $2010 to allow for a margin of error—to get you into the market once the sideways range is broken to the upside. 

If we check other pro exchange platforms such as ````binance.com````, we can find majority of them support stop orders, including both ````StopEntryIncrease```` and ````StopLossDecrease````.
