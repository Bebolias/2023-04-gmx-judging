# Incorrect min balance validation

## Summary

The `MarketUtils` library's `validateMarketTokenBalance` function incorrectly checks min possible balances that can block fees withdrawing. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `validateMarketTokenBalance` separately checks conditions `balance < expectedMinBalance` and `balance < claimableFundingFeeAmount` ang throws an error in case of `true`. There is a possible case when both conditions are `false`, but withdrawing funding fees is impossible, because `balance - claimableFundingFeeAmount` will be less than `expectedMinBalance`.

## Impact

This vulnerability can block fees withdrawing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I suggest checking if `balance - expectedMinBalance < claimableFundingFeeAmount` instead of  `balance < claimableFundingFeeAmount`.
