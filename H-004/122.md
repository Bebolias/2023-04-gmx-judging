# Stop-loss order execute with the `triggerPrice` instead of the prevailing market price

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
This [block](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/BaseOrderUtils.sol#L288-L298) just set the `triggerPrice` to min and max price in both cases (long and short position)
```solidity
            if (shouldValidateAscendingPrice) {
                oracle.setCustomPrice(indexToken, Price.Props(
                    triggerPrice, // min price that order can be executed with
                    triggerPrice // max price that order can be executed with
                ));
            } else {
                oracle.setCustomPrice(indexToken, Price.Props(
                    triggerPrice, // min price that order can be executed with
                    triggerPrice // max price that order can be executed with
                ));
            }
```
The price just needs to be between `primaryPrice` and `secondaryPrice` and the stop-loss order will execute with the `triggerPrice` rather than the current market price 

## Impact
- The order will execute with the wrong price. this will lead the protocol to lose funds 
- The order will execute at a price higher than the prevailing market price (for long positions). Users will save more funds

## Recommendation
use `secondaryPrice.min` with the long position and `secondaryPrice.max` for the short
