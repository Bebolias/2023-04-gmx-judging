# Tokens without a `PriceFeed` are  exposed to a price deviation

## Summary
[oracle._setPrices()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/oracle/Oracle.sol#L518-L557) function is a helper function that is called by the `setPrices()` function.

In case the token has a price feed this block will check the price deviation
```solidity
            if (hasPriceFeed) {
                validateRefPrice(
                    reportInfo.token,
                    medianMinPrice,
                    refPrice,
                    cache.maxRefPriceDeviationFactor
                );

                validateRefPrice(
                    reportInfo.token,
                    medianMaxPrice,
                    refPrice,
                    cache.maxRefPriceDeviationFactor
                );
            }
```
## Vulnerability Detail
If the token has no `PriceFeed` it will set the `medianPrice` for min and max to `primaryPrices/secondaryPrices[ ]`. 
but there is no check for price deviation. if one of the source data, which keepers depend on signs prices from it exposed to a price deviation. (e.g.in case a big amount is sold in a short time in one marketplace)

## Impact
- Tokens without a `PriceFeed` are  exposed to a price deviation
- Protocol/user will lose funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You should compare all the min/max prices together to check if one price is too different from all others
