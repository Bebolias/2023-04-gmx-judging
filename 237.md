# Traders can get prices prior to their orders using acceptable prices below trigger prices

## Summary

Traders can get prices prior to their orders using acceptable prices


## Vulnerability Detail

A change since the prior contest was to allow limit orders to take place using prices in the same block in which the order was submitted, and to use the trigger price as one of the prices available to orders. Another price available to the trader is the min/max price. If a trader sees that a single block contains a range of prices, the trader can submit an order with a trigger price at the current market price, but use an acceptable price lower than the trigger price.

When the trigger price can't fulfill the acceptable price, the acceptable price is used instead.


## Impact

Traders will get a free look into the future at the expense of the other side of the trade. Price gaps in crypto are very common, so this will be a frequent occurance.


## Code Snippet

The acceptable price is used if acceptable is lower than the trigger price:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/BaseOrderUtils.sol : BaseOrderUtils.getExecutionPrice()   #1

351            // for limit orders, customIndexTokenPrice contains the triggerPrice and the best oracle
352            // price, we first attempt to fulfill the order using the triggerPrice
353            uint256 price = customIndexTokenPrice.pickPrice(shouldUseMaxPrice);
...
381            // if the order could not be fulfilled using the triggerPrice
382            // check if the best oracle price can fulfill the order
383            price = customIndexTokenPrice.pickPrice(!shouldUseMaxPrice);
384    
385            // adjust price by price impact
386            if (sizeDeltaUsd > 0) {
387                price = price * Calc.sumReturnUint256(sizeDeltaUsd, priceImpactUsdForPriceAdjustment) / sizeDeltaUsd;
388            }
389    
390            if (shouldPriceBeSmaller && price <= acceptablePrice) {
391                return acceptablePrice;
392            }
393    
394            if (!shouldPriceBeSmaller && price >= acceptablePrice) {
395                return acceptablePrice;
396:           }

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Don't allow the acceptable price to be at a better price than the trigger price
