# IncreasePositionUtils.increasePosition() might determine the collateral amount is sufficient even when it is not.

## Summary
``IncreasePositionUtils.increasePosition()`` might determine the collateral amount is sufficient even when it is not.  The main problem is that when it calls ``PositionUtils.willPositionCollateralBeSufficient()`` to check the sufficiency of collateral, it fails to consider the impact of PnL of the position. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider a scenario that an order keeper executes a LimitIncrease order with the flow ``OrderHandler.executeOrder() -> _executeOrder() -> OrderUtils.executeOrder() -> processOrder() -> IncreaseOrderUtils.processOrder() -> IncreasePositionUtils.increasePosition()``.  Let's look at function ``IncreasePositionUtils.increasePosition()``:

After a position is increased and persisted to the storage, the function calls ``PositionUtils.willPositionCollateralBeSufficient()`` to see if the collateral is sufficient. However at L166, it sets ``positionValues.realizedPnlUsd = 0``, as a result, ``PositionUtils.willPositionCollateralBeSufficient()``  will not consider the effect of the profit and loss of the position at all. In other words, if the position is in a large loss, the collateral might not be actually sufficient to cover that loss. Unfortunately, due to the value ``positionValues.realizedPnlUsd = 0``, the function will wrongly determine that the collateral is sufficient even when it is NOT.

## Impact

IncreasePositionUtils.increasePosition() might determine the collateral amount is sufficient even when it is not.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
``positionValues.realizedPnlUsd`` should be assigned a value of the current Pnl of the position, in this way, the function ``PositionUtils.willPositionCollateralBeSufficient()`` will perform more accurately for its evaluation of the sufficiency of the collateral.
