# If a token's oracle goes down or price falls to zero, liquidations will be frozen

## Summary
In some extreme cases, oracles can be taken offline or token prices can fall to zero. In these cases, liquidations, deposits and withdrawals will be frozen (all calls will revert).

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink has taken oracles offline in extreme cases. For example, during the UST collapse, Chainlink paused the UST/ETH price oracle, to ensure that it wasn't providing inaccurate data to protocols.

In such a situation (or one in which the token's price falls to zero), all liquidations, deposits and withdrawals for users holding the frozen asset would revert. 

Depending on the specifics, one of the following checks would cause the revert:

- the call to Chainlink's oracle `priceFeed.latestRoundData` would fail
-  if ( _price <= 0) revert Errors.InvalidFeedPrice(token, _price);

The code that would revert it is called from the `setPrices` function in the oracle contract. Meaning that any function implementing the modifier:

```solidity
    modifier withOraclePrices(
        Oracle oracle,
        DataStore dataStore,
        EventEmitter eventEmitter,
        OracleUtils.SetPricesParams memory params
    ) {
        oracle.setPrices(dataStore, eventEmitter, params);   <----- HERE
        _;
        oracle.clearAllPrices();
    }
```
would fail given the previous conditions, breaking core functionality of the entire protocol.

Some of the affected functions are: `executeWithdrawal` `executeOrder` `executeLiquidation` `executeDeposit` `updateAdlState` `executeAdl`

If the oracle price lookup reverts, liquidations, withdrawals and deposits will be frozen.

## Impact
Liquidations, deposits, and withdrawals, may not be possible at a time when the protocol needs them most. As a result, the value of user's asset may fall below their debts, turning off any liquidation incentive and pushing the protocol into insolvency.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use try/catch block. The logic for getting the token's price from the Chainlink data feed should be placed in the try block, while some fallback logic when the access to the chainlink oracle data feed is denied should be placed in the catch block. E.g:

```solidity
function getPrice(address priceFeedAddress) external view returns (int256) {
        try priceFeed.latestRoundData() returns (
            uint80,         // roundID
            int256 price,   // price
            uint256,        // startedAt
            uint256,        // timestamp
            uint80          // answeredInRound
        ) {
            return price;
        } catch Error(string memory) {            
            // handle failure here:
            // revert, call propietary fallback oracle, fetch from another 3rd-party oracle, etc.
        }
    }
```
