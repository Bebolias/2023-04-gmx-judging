# collateralCache.adjustedPriceImpactDiffAmount of collateral is made as a reward to the order maker instead of as a penalty.

## Summary
``collateralCache.adjustedPriceImpactDiffAmount`` of collateral is made as a reward to the order maker instead of as a penalty. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In another report, I have reported that ``collateralCache.pnlDiffAmount``, the pnlDifferenceAmount was sent to the receiver designated by the order maker instead of the holding area. This reports another incident somewhat related, but is independent occurrence. The former occurs at L134 of ``DecreasePositionCollateralUtils``. This reports focus on L286 regarding ``fcollateralCache.adjustedPriceImpactDiffAmount``.

What is adjustedPriceImpactDiffAmount? It reflects the difference of capped price impact and the real price impact in term of collateral tokens. It is the debt that an order maker needs to pay due to PNL imbalance penalty. Let's look at this more carefully.

Consider an order keeper who executes  a MarketIncrease order with the flow ``OrderHandler.executeOrder() -> _executeOrder() -> OrderUtils.executeOrder() -> processOrder() -> DecreaseOrderUtils.processOrder() -> DecreasePositionUtils.decreasePosition() -> DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.processCollateral()``, in particular function   ``DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.processCollateral()``.

First, at L65, the function call ``getExecutionPrice()`` to calculate the trade execution price and ``values.priceImpactDiffUsd``:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.sol#L283-L340](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.sol#L283-L340)

As seen at L317 ``values.priceImpactDiffUsd`` captures the difference between the capped minPriceImpactUsd and the real priceImpactDIffUsd. That is the debt a user needs to pay.

This difference, eventually is converted into ``adjustedPriceImpactDiffAmount`` in terms of collateral amount: 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.sol#L77-L89](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.sol#L77-L89)

However, instead of paying the protocol this penalty, this amount is finally made claimable to the order made is a reward, which is a logical error: 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.sol#L251-L257](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.sol#L251-L257)


## Impact
collateralCache.adjustedPriceImpactDiffAmount of collateral is made as a reward to the order maker instead of as a penalty.  Such logical error might lead to unpredicable behavior to the system, even encouraging users to game from the system by receiving reward/no penalty as a result of imbalacing the system.

## Recommendation
Treat ``collateralCache.adjustedPriceImpactDiffAmount`` as a penalty rather than a reward.
