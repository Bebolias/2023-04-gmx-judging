# Token Wrapper Function with Inadequate Ether Verification

## Summary:The function sendWnt() in the  Exchange Contract  is designed to wrap tokens and return the wrapped token to the caller, but it utilizes the amount specified in the call as the amount of wrapped token to return.
## Vulnerability Detail:Instead of verifying the actual amount of ether sent, the function uses the specified amount as the quantity to return to the caller. This approach assumes that the user will provide the correct and expected amount, which can be easily manipulated by malicious actors.

## Impact:
Loss of Funds: Malicious actors can exploit the function by specifying a smaller amount of ether in the call than what they actually sent. As a result, they can receive more wrapped tokens than they deserve, leading to financial loss for the contract.



## Code Snippet:https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/06ccd8c7ee4cadc46e3ac412dcf141eefdced42f/gmx-synthetics/contracts/router/ExchangeRouter.sol#L90

## Tool used:Past Reports

Manual Review

## Recommendation:Implement a check-effect-interact patttern i.e modify the function to include an explicit verification step to confirm the actual amount of ether sent with the call matches the expected value. This verification should be performed before initiating the token wrapping process.
