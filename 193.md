# There is a divide-before-multiply precision loss in MarketUtils.getFundingFeeAmount().

## Summary
There is a divide-before-multiply precision loss in ``MarketUtils.getFundingFeeAmount()``.

## Vulnerability Detail
``MarketUtils.getFundingFeeAmount()`` is used to get the funding fee amount to be deducted or distributed.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1340-L1374])https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1340-L1374)

However, there is a divide-before-multiply precision loss problem shown below:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1353-L1355](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1353-L1355)

which means 1.999Precision.FLOAT_PRECISION_SQRT will become 1.0 Precision.FLOAT_PRECISION_SQRT. 

This might be a minor problem per se. However the internal accounting will have check such as ``balance < claimableFundingFeeAmount``. When getFundingFeeAmount() is not calculated in favor of the system consistently - in our case, the payer might pay less than he is supposed to due to the precision loss as a result of divide-before-multiply. As a result, in the long run,  the pool might have no sufficient funds to pay for the receivers, the health of the pool will be in compromise.

## Impact
There is a divide-before-multiply precision loss in MarketUtils.getFundingFeeAmount().
