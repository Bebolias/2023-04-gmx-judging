# [H] [05-22 19:00] Malicious AdlKeeper could drain the treasury

## Summary
Adl or auto-deleverages. the ADL keeper invokes [AdlHandler.executeAdl()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/AdlHandler.sol#L89-L164) to decrease pending profits below the allowed thresholds
[this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/OrderUtils.sol#L178) comment says 
```solidity
//gas costs for liquidations / adl is subsidised by the treasury
```

## Vulnerability Detail
If Adl is enabled, Malicious AdlKeeper could keep invoking `AdlHandler.executeAdl()` with dust amount for `sizeDeltaUsd`.
the treasury will pay gas costs every time and this is not healthy for it  

## Impact
Malicious AdlKeeper could drain the treasury 

## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The easiest, but not the most efficient add a minimum amount for `sizeDeltaUsd`
