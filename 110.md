# AdlKeeper could kicked-out the user arbitrarily

## Summary
The space of [AdlHandler.executeAdl()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/AdlHandler.sol#L89-L164)
```solidity
    // @dev auto-deleverages a position
    // there is no validation that ADL is executed in order of position profit
    // or position size, this is due to the limitation of the gas overhead
    // required to check this ordering
```
so the order of position profit and position size is ignored here and the ADL keeper can pick any position to `executeAdl()`

## Vulnerability Detail
The Adl Keeper is able to close any position if the Adl is enabled, even if he can just close a percentage from the position (e.g.50%) to achieve the thresholds again.
so the users will lose their position arbitrarily and this will deprive them of some expected profits.

Also, Adl Keeper could take advantage of the enabled Adl to close his position and this will lead him to avoid paying the `executionFee`

## Impact
- Users may experience arbitrary position close, resulting in the deprivation of anticipated profits.
- Adl Keeper could bypassing `executionFee`

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Check the thresholds with the current `sizeDeltaUsd` and adjust it if it is too big 
- Keep a percentage for every  position open so Adl Keeper needs to pay `executionFee` in order full close
