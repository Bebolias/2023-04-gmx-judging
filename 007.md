# Inefficient role lookup

## Summary

The RoleStore contract implements an inefficient role lookup mechanism, which could lead to increased gas costs and slower execution times.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `roleCache` mapping in the RoleStore contract is used for role lookup, but it is not efficiently implemented. Each role lookup operation involves two mappings, which increases gas costs and slows down execution times.

## Impact

The inefficient role lookup mechanism may lead to increased gas costs and slower execution times, negatively affecting the user experience and increasing the overall cost of using the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Optimize the role lookup mechanism by using a single mapping with a tuple as the key or by implementing a more efficient data structure for role management. Alternatively, consider using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl contract, which has a more efficient role management implementation.
