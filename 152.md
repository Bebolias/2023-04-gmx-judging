# UI fee is still counted when `uiFeeReceiver` is `address(0)`

## Summary

UI fee is used to pay the fee to the front-end. In some scenarios, there is no front-end participation (for example, the user directly calls), in which case `uiFeeReceiver` is `address(0)`. But the protocol will still deduct the UI fee and add it to amount of `address(0)`, and no one can withdraw these fees.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File:
 62     function incrementClaimableUiFeeAmount(
 63         DataStore dataStore,
 64         EventEmitter eventEmitter,
 65         address uiFeeReceiver,
 66         address market,
 67         address token,
 68         uint256 delta,
 69         bytes32 feeType
 70     ) external {
 71         if (delta == 0) {
 72             return;
 73         }
 74
 75         uint256 nextValue = dataStore.incrementUint(
 76             Keys.claimableUiFeeAmountKey(market, token, uiFeeReceiver),
 77             delta
 78         );
 79
 80         uint256 nextPoolValue = dataStore.incrementUint(
 81             Keys.claimableUiFeeAmountKey(market, token),
 82             delta
 83         );
```

Even if `uiFeeReceiver` is `0`, the UI fee is still counted.

## Impact

In the absence of UI participation, the user is still counted UI fee, resulting in loss of funds.

## Recommendation

It is recommended not to count UI fee in some cases without front-end participation
