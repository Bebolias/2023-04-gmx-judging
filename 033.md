# _executeWithdrawal() setting the minOutputAmount from prices.shortTokenPrice.min, when price market is unasfe, it will casue user lossing fund.

## Summary

Function _executeWithdrawal() setting the minOutputAmount from prices.shortTokenPrice.min. When the prices market fluctuates violently, it will casue user lossing fund.

## Vulnerability Detail

In _executeWithdrawal(), it setting the minOutputAmount from prices.shortTokenPrice.min at two points

```solidity
SwapPricingUtils.emitSwapFeesCollected(
            params.eventEmitter,
            market.marketToken,
            market.longToken,
            prices.longTokenPrice.min, //@audit the price.min is came from market's price ,so the slippage is wrong
            "withdrawal",
            cache.longTokenFees
        );
```

And the prices is set:
```solidity
MarketUtils.MarketPrices memory prices = MarketUtils.getMarketPrices(
            params.oracle,
            market
        );
```
Even the Oracle is came from `params.oracle`, the protocol should receive param.minOutputAmount and check `prices.longTokenPrice.min` in order to prevent user losses when the market fluctuates greatly and when the market is wrong


## Impact
