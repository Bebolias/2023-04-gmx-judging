# User-supplied slippage for decrease orders is ignored

## Summary

The user-supplied minOutputAmount order parameter for controlling slippage is ignored when a user decreases their position. 

## Vulnerability Detail

There are no checks that the amount out matches the user-supplied value during order creation, and in fact infinite slippage is allowed during the swap of PNL and collateral, ensuring there are opportunities for sandwiching.

Issue still stands: Infinite slippage is allowed during the swap from collateral tokens to the PNL token:

```solidity
File: gmx-synthetics\contracts\position\DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.sol
406: 
407:             try params.contracts.swapHandler.swap(
408:                 SwapUtils.SwapParams(
409:                     params.contracts.dataStore,
410:                     params.contracts.eventEmitter,
411:                     params.contracts.oracle,
412:                     Bank(payable(params.market.marketToken)),
413:                     params.orderKey,
414:                     params.position.collateralToken(), // tokenIn
415:                     values.output.outputAmount, // amountIn
416:                     swapPathMarkets, // markets
417: @>                  0, // minOutputAmount 
418:                     params.market.marketToken, // receiver
419:                     params.order.uiFeeReceiver(), // uiFeeReceiver
420:                     false // shouldUnwrapNativeToken
421:                 )

```

## Impact

User's orders will have swap impacts applied to them during swaps, resulting in the user getting less than they asked for.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

require() that the final output amount is equal to the requested amount, after the position is decreased but before funds are transferred.
