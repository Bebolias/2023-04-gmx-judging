# MarketUtils.getPnlToPoolFactor() will NOT minimize the returned factor when maximize == false.

## Summary
MarketUtils.getPnlToPoolFactor() allows one to get the PnlToPool factor, either minimized or maximized. However, when maximize == false, the returned result is actually not minimized. 

## Vulnerability Detail
MarketUtils.getPnlToPoolFactor() allows one to get the PnlToPool factor, either minimized or maximized.

However, when maximize == false, the returned result is actually not minimized. To minimize the result for maximize == false, we need to minimize the numerator, Pnl, which is done below; at the same time, we need to maximize the denominator, the Pool value, which is NOT done.

As a matter of fact, the calculation of Pool value is minimized:

As a result, MarketUtils.getPnlToPoolFactor() will NOT minimize the returned factor when maximize == false.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We need to minimize the returned factor when maximize == false by maximing the pool value in this case.
