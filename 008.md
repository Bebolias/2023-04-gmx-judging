# Possible Front-Running Vulnerability

## Summary

The SwapUtils.sol contract is potentially vulnerable to front-running attacks since it doesn't use any mechanisms to mitigate them.

## Vulnerability Detail

Front-running attacks occur when an attacker observes a pending transaction and quickly submits another transaction with a higher gas price, allowing their transaction to be processed first. This could allow the attacker to manipulate the order of transactions and potentially profit from them.

In the `swap` function of SwapUtils.sol, there are no safeguards implemented to prevent front-running attacks. An attacker may monitor pending transactions and submit their own transactions with higher gas prices to benefit from the price difference.

## Impact

If an attacker successfully performs a front-running attack, they can potentially profit at the expense of other users. This may lead to a loss of user trust and could negatively impact the protocol's reputation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate front-running attacks, consider implementing mechanisms such as batch auctions or commit-reveal schemes. These methods help ensure that transactions are processed fairly and reduce the potential for attackers to profit from front-running.
