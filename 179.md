# Fix for "Limit orders are broken when there are price gaps" does not work properly

## Summary
Fix for "Limit orders are broken when there are price gaps" does not work properly
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/140
in the report above we see a problem with Limit orders failing to execute when the price becomes worse for the order in the block after the order is submitted.
the protocol team implemented a fix for this issue
```solidity
if (orderType == Order.OrderType.LimitIncrease ||
            orderType == Order.OrderType.LimitDecrease
        ) {
            uint256 primaryPrice = oracle.getPrimaryPrice(indexToken).pickPrice(shouldUseMaxPrice);

            // for limit increase orders:
            //      - long: validate primaryPrice < triggerPrice
            //      - short: validate primaryPrice > triggerPrice
            // for limit decrease orders:
            //      - long: validate primaryPrice > triggerPrice
            //      - short: validate primaryPrice < triggerPrice
            bool shouldValidateSmallerPrimaryPrice = shouldUseMaxPrice;

            bool ok = shouldValidateSmallerPrimaryPrice ? primaryPrice <= triggerPrice : primaryPrice >= triggerPrice;

            if (!ok) {
                revert Errors.InvalidLimitOrderPrices(primaryPrice, triggerPrice, shouldValidateSmallerPrimaryPrice);
            }

            if (shouldValidateSmallerPrimaryPrice) {
                oracle.setCustomPrice(indexToken, Price.Props(
                    primaryPrice, // min price that order can be executed with
                    triggerPrice // max price that order can be executed with
                ));
            } else {
                oracle.setCustomPrice(indexToken, Price.Props(
                    triggerPrice, // min price that order can be executed with
                    primaryPrice // max price that order can be executed with
                ));
            }
```
However we believe implementation should use the maximum of primaryPrice and secondaryPrice  which will the optimum return to the user though they had set the triggerprice
in the else snippet shown below
```solidity
oracle.setCustomPrice(indexToken, Price.Props(
                    triggerPrice, // min price that order can be executed with
                    //maxi of primary or secondary can be used here
                    primaryPrice // max price that order can be executed with 
                ));
```
## Impact
> If the primary/secondary prices go well past the trigger price (e.g. due to a price gap), then the order execution will revert, leaving the user exposed to their position, even if they had a valid stoploss set.
