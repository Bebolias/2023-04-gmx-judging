# The pool adjustment config parameters won't work properly when long and short collateral are the same

## Summary

The pool adjustment config parameters won't work properly when the long token collateral and short token collateral are the same token


## Vulnerability Detail

The `Keys.poolAmountAdjustmentKey()` is built using the market token address and the collateral token address, but doesn't take into account whether the adjustment is for the long side or for the short side


## Impact

If an adjustment is indended for one side, it will be applied to both, disrupting the expected effect. It will alter all swap impacts for funds flowing through that market, leading to users beeing charged more or less than they should be, given what the admin intended to have happen.


## Code Snippet

Adjustments aren't set based on which side needs the adjustment:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/pricing/SwapPricingUtils.sol : SwapPricingUtils.getNextPoolAmountsParams()   #1

208 @>         int256 poolUsdAdjustmentForTokenA = params.dataStore.getInt(Keys.poolAmountAdjustmentKey(params.market.marketToken, params.tokenA)) * params.priceForTokenA.toInt256();
209:@>         int256 poolUsdAdjustmentForTokenB = params.dataStore.getInt(Keys.poolAmountAdjustmentKey(params.market.marketToken, params.tokenB)) * params.priceForTokenB.toInt256();

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Include the side in the key hash
