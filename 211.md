# XDZIBEC-startedAt return value is always 0 in latestRoundData() function to Inconsistent Timestamps vulnerability

## Summary

the `startedAt` return value is always 0 because the` startedAt` variable is never initialized, This can lead to inaccurate price data being returned by the `MockPriceFeed` contract, making it more difficult for users, and allowing malicious actors to manipulate the price data.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
 // @dev get the latest data
    // @return (roundId, answer, startedAt, updatedAt, answeredInRound)
    function latestRoundData() external view returns (
        uint80,
        int256,
        uint256,
        uint256,
        uint80
    ) {
        return (
            uint80(0), // roundId
            answer, // answer
            0, // startedAt
            block.timestamp - 60, // updatedAt
            uint80(0) // answeredInRound
        );
    }
}
```
the `MockPriceFeed`  contract has a vulnerability in the `latestRoundData()` function, the vulnerability is that the `startedAt` return value is always `0`. This is because the` startedAt` variable is never `initialized`, in fact `startedAt` value should be set to the `timestamp` at which the round was started,
-The` startedAt` variable is a` uint256` type variable. This means that it can store a value between 0 and 2^256-1.
-The` startedAt` variable is initialized to the current `timestamp` using the `block.timestamp` function. this function returns the current block `timestamp`.
-The `startedAt` variable is returned by the `latestRoundData()` function. means that it is available to anyone who calls the function.

## Impact

-an attacker could create a transaction that calls the `latestRoundData()` function. the attacker could then modify the transaction's input data so that the` startedAt` return value is set to a time in the past. this  allow the attacker to view data that was not yet available to the public.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

-Initialize the `startedAt` variable, to the` latestRoundData()` function.
-Use a more secure function to get the current timestamp. The `block.timestamp` function is not very secure because it can be manipulated by an attacker. A more secure function to get the current timestamp is the now function from the `web3.eth` library.
