# openInterest bug is not fixed properly

## Summary
Logic for setting nextOpenInterest values received an incorrect fix that allows the impact from previous report to persist
## Vulnerability Detail
In the report above the watson suggest this fix
> Remove these lines in the if-brackets:
nextLongOpenInterest = Calc.sumReturnUint256(longOpenInterest, params.usdDelta);
nextShortOpenInterest = Calc.sumReturnUint256(shortOpenInterest, params.usdDelta);
And add these lines before openInterestParams assignment in getNextOpenInterestParams():
nextLongOpenInterest = isLong ? longOpenInterest + sizeDeltaUsd : longOpenInterest
nextShortOpenInterest = !isLong ? shortOpenInterest + sizeDeltaUsd : shortOpenInterest

The devs have instead employed the following fix https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-synthetics/commit/b04edccc87babc619dd769c66b6af03313885bd3#diff-a55999ce9f39e71ebdbba926a95106f518c50970f0ca74b09d38add61d79d2b5R330
```solidty
   uint256 nextLongOpenInterest = longOpenInterest;
        uint256 nextShortOpenInterest = shortOpenInterest;
```
one thing to note about the fix is the sizeDetalUsd is missing. This will continue nextOpenInterest to be calculated correctly.
## Impact
the `nextOpenInterest` will be calculated incorrectly and cause trouble for the entire protocol. as explained by the report 
> Should the open interest values be really large, then the implication of having 0 value as next open interest value for one side is quite significant.
This causes the consequent price impact calculations based on current and next open interest values to be materially incorrect.
This causes boolean value isSameSideRebalance in _getPriceImpactUsd() function to have an incorrect value.
For a user who could actually be improving the balance in the market and should be given a positive price impact, this calculation would lead to negative price impact that is very large in magnitude and hence loss of user funds.
