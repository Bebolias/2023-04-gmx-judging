# MarketUtils#getNextFundingAmountPerSize() should not scale the funding by the size of the open interest (the larger side).

## Summary
MarketUtils#getNextFundingAmountPerSize() should not scale up the funding by the size of the open interest (the larger side). The argument is that the imbalance between both sides relies on the difference of open interests of both sides, not the size of open interests of the larger side. 

## Vulnerability Detail

``MarketUtils#getNextFundingAmountPerSize()`` is used to calculate the  next funding amount per size values:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L991-L1124C6](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L991-L1124C6)

It calculates the the total funding amount by: 

1. Calculate the difference between the open interests of both sides (``cache.diffUsd``)
2. Calculate the funding factor per second as ``result.fundingFactorPerSecond  = F * (diff^e)/T`` where F: funding factor for the market; diff: difference between the open interests of both sides; e: exponent factor for the market; T: total open interests. 
3. Calculate the total funding as: ``cache.fundingUsd = Precision.applyFactor(cache.sizeOfLargerSide, cache.durationInSeconds * result.fundingFactorPerSecond)``;

However, the funding amount should only reflect the imbalance, or imbalance percentage (divided by the total amount of interests), but not the absolute size of the larger open interest. 

For example, suppose the long open interest is 1000e18+1 and the short open interest is 1000e18. That is they only have difference of 1. However, the funding amount will still be scaled by 1000e18+1.

 A more reasonable design would scale it by the diff, which measure the imbalance. 

## Impact
``MarketUtils#getNextFundingAmountPerSize()`` should not scale the funding by the size of the open interest (the larger side). Otherwise, larger side will be punished proportionally to their size instead of in proportion to the size of the difference of open interests from both sides.

## Recommendation
More reasonable calculation: 

```javascript
cache.fundingUsd = Precision.applyFactor(cache.diffUsd, cache.durationInSeconds * result.fundingFactorPerSecond)``;
```
