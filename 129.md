# Borrowing fees are still assessed even if the market gets disabled for a period of time

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
- Temporary disabling of any market is possible for a certain period.
- Both `IncreasePositionUtils.sol` and `DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.sol` invoke this function [PositionPricingUtils.getPositionFees()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/pricing/PositionPricingUtils.sol#L390-L394) in order to compute the necessary fees.

`PositionPricingUtils.getPositionFees()` will keep acquiring the borrowing Fees 
```solidity
    function getBorrowingFees(
        DataStore dataStore,
        Price.Props memory collateralTokenPrice,
        uint256 borrowingFeeUsd
    ) internal view returns (PositionBorrowingFees memory) {
        PositionBorrowingFees memory borrowingFees;

        borrowingFees.borrowingFeeUsd = borrowingFeeUsd;
        borrowingFees.borrowingFeeAmount = borrowingFeeUsd / collateralTokenPrice.min;
        borrowingFees.borrowingFeeReceiverFactor = dataStore.getUint(Keys.BORROWING_FEE_RECEIVER_FACTOR);
        borrowingFees.borrowingFeeAmountForFeeReceiver = Precision.applyFactor(borrowingFees.borrowingFeeAmount, borrowingFees.borrowingFeeReceiverFactor);

        return borrowingFees;
    }
```
And the user has no way to close his position (stop acquiring borrowing Fees) when the market gets disabled. 

## Impact
Borrowing fees are still assessed even if the market gets disabled for a period of time
