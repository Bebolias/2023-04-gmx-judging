# XDZIBEC-Arbitrary Code Execution via Overridden _afterTransferOut Function in Bank Contract

## Summary

 a vulnerability  in the` Bank` contract. 
The vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit the `_afterTransferOut` function, which is defined as an empty internal virtual function. By overriding this function in a derived contract, an attacker can execute `arbitrary` code when `tokens `are `transferred out` of the contract. 
This can lead to unauthorized actions or malicious behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_afterTransferOut` function in the` Bank `contract is defined as follows:

```SOLIDITY
    function _afterTransferOut(address /* token */) internal virtual {}
}
```
The function is empty and does not contain any logic or checks. As a result, it can be overridden by a derived contract to introduce arbitrary code execution.
The `_afterTransferOut` function is defined as an internal virtual function that takes an address argument named `token`, which is not used within the function `body`.it's allows an attacker to exploit the function by overriding it in a derived contract and executing arbitrary code when `tokens` are transferred out of the contract. 
An attacker can redefine `_afterTransferOut` and introduce malicious behavior, potentially causing a security breach or undesired consequences.

## Impact

By overriding the `_afterTransferOut` function, an attacker can execute malicious actions when tokens are transferred out of the contract. This can lead to unauthorized token transfers, manipulation of contract state, or other undesired consequences depending on the introduced code.
An attacker could use the vulnerability to steal tokens, manipulate contract state, or perform other malicious actions.

- Here is a poc for the vulnerability :

1-Deploy the Bank contract with the following constructor arguments:
   `_roleStore`: Address of the `RoleStore` contract
   `_dataStore`: Address of the `DataStore` contract

2-Assign the `onlyController `role to an `attacker-controlled address`. This can be done by calling the appropriate function in the `RoleStore` contract.

3-Call the `transferOut `function in the Bank contract with the following arguments:
    `token`: Address of the `token` to transfer
   ` receiver:` Attacker's address
   ` amount`: Desired `amount `to transfer
4-As a result, the `_transferOut` function will be invoked, transferring the specified token amount to the attacker's address.
5-Since the `_afterTransferOut `function is not overridden in the` Bank` contract, it will call the empty internal `_afterTransferOut` function by default.
6-The attacker can now call the `transferOut` function again, providing a different destination address and transfer `tokens` from the contract to that address.
Explanation:
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `_afterTransferOut` function is left unimplemented in the Bank contract, making it susceptible to arbitrary code execution. By assigning the `onlyController` role to an attacker-controlled address, the attacker can exploit this vulnerability and execute arbitrary code.
It's allows an attacker with the `onlyController `role to transfer tokens from the contract to any desired address and potentially manipulate the contract's behavior in unintended ways.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to either remove the `_afterTransferOut` function if it serves no purpose or implement appropriate checks and safeguards within the function to prevent unauthorized or malicious actions. Consider validating the `caller's` identity or implementing a permission system to ensure that only trusted contracts can override this function. Additionally, carefully review and validate any derived contracts that inherit from `Bank` to ensure they do not introduce any `malicious` behavior through the overridden `_afterTransferOut` function.
