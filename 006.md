# Potential reentrancy vulnerability in RoleModule

## Summary

RoleModule contract exposes a potential reentrancy vulnerability due to external calls made in the middle of its functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_validateRole` function in the RoleModule contract calls `roleStore.hasRole`, which is an external call to the RoleStore contract. This may introduce a reentrancy vulnerability if the RoleStore contract is compromised or if a malicious contract is used as the role store.

## Impact

A compromised role store could potentially exploit the reentrancy vulnerability to call back into the RoleModule contract and perform unauthorized actions, leading to a loss of funds or unauthorized access to the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement proper reentrancy protection using the `reentrancyGuard` modifier or similar pattern. Alternatively, consider reordering the code to perform the external call at the end of the function.
