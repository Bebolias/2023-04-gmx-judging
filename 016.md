# Missing input validation for createDeposit

## Summary

The function `createDeposit` does not have input validation for `params`, allowing a potential attacker to create a deposit with invalid data, causing incorrect calculations or other issues.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `createDeposit` function, the `params` input is passed directly to the `depositHandler.createDeposit` function without any validation. This could lead to unexpected behavior if an attacker can craft a deposit with invalid data.

## Impact

An attacker could create deposits with invalid data, potentially leading to incorrect calculations or other issues within the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add input validation for `params` within the `createDeposit` function to ensure that only valid deposits can be created. This can be achieved by adding checks for the required parameters and ensuring they are within the expected bounds.
