# XDZIBEC-vulnerability in Bank contract allows for transfer of wrapped native tokens to attacker-controlled addresses

## Summary

there is a  vulnerability  in the `Bank` contract it's allows an attacker to exploit the` _afterTransferOut` function to transfer `wrapped` native `tokens` to an address of their choosing. this could be used to `steal tokens` from users of the Bank contract.
this vulnerability is caused by a `comment` in the `_afterTransferOut` function declaration. The `comment` indicates that the `token` `parameter` is `unused`, the function actually does use the `token parameter`.
an attacker can  exploit this vulnerability  by calling the `_afterTransferOut `function with the` token parameter` set to the address of a wrapped native `token`. The `_afterTransferOut` function then `transfers` the `wrapped native tokens` to the address specified by the `attacker`, the vulnerability could be used to `steal tokens` from users of the Bank contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail

   ```solidity
 }

    function _afterTransferOut(address /* token */) internal virtual {}
}

```

the vulnerability in `_afterTransferOut` function, declared as:

```solidity
function _afterTransferOut(address /* token */) internal virtual {}
```

The `/* token */ `comment indicates that the `token parameter` is `unused`, the function actually does use the `token parameter`. In the `_transferOutNativeToken `function, the `_afterTransferOut` function is called with the` token parameter` set to the address of the `wrapped native token`.  the issue that the `_afterTransferOut` function is not designed to handle `transfers of wrapped native tokens`.


## Impact

An attacker could call the _afterTransferOut function with the token parameter set to the address of a wrapped native token that they control. The _afterTransferOut function would then transfer the wrapped native tokens to the attacker's address.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- to fix the vulnerability  remove the` /* token */` comment from the `_afterTransferOut` function declaration. this will ensure that the `_afterTransferOut` function is only called with the token parameter set to the address of a `non-wrapped native token`.
