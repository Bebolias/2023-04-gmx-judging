# MarketUtils.getFundingFeeAmount() has a rounding problem, leading to a user to pay less funding amount than required.

## Summary
MarketUtils.getFundingFeeAmount() has a rounding problem.  The main issue is that: it always uses a rounding down for calculating ``adjustedPositionSizeInUsd`` regardless the sign of ``fundingDiffFactor``. In principle, rounding should always be in favor of the system: when funding amount is negative, we need to use rounding down, when funding amount is positive, we need to use rounding up. 

## Vulnerability Detail
MarketUtils.getFundingFeeAmount() is used to calculate the amount of funding fee a position needs to pay or receive (claim).

In principle, rounding should always be in favor of the system: when funding amount is negative, we need to use rounding down, when funding amount is positive, we need to use rounding up. 

However, the function consistently performs a rounding down for the calculation of ``adjustedPositionSizeInUsd``. As a result, the final result, when it is positive, is not fully rounding up (due to the partial rounding down). In other words, a user is paying less funding amount than he is supposed to. 

## Impact
MarketUtils.getFundingFeeAmount() has a rounding problem, leading to a user to pay less funding amount than required.

## Recommendation
use a rounding  up to calculate ``adjustedPositionSizeInUsd`` when the funding amount is positive.
