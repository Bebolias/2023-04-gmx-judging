# An order creator can always receive the uiFee himself.

## Summary
An order creator can always designate himself as the uiFeeReceiver and as a result,  receive the uiFee himself. 

## Vulnerability Detail

``ExchangeRouter#createOrder()`` allows a user to create a new order with the given amount and order parameters.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/router/ExchangeRouter.sol#L168-L177](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/router/ExchangeRouter.sol#L168-L177)

One of the parameters that can be specified is: ``uiFeeReceiver``:

```javascript
 struct CreateOrderParamsAddresses {
        address receiver;
        address callbackContract;
        address uiFeeReceiver;
        address market;
        address initialCollateralToken;
        address[] swapPath;
    }
``` 
Therefore, the user can designate himself as  ``uiFeeReceiver`` and receives all the uifees. 

## Impact
A user who creates an order can  designate himself as  ``uiFeeReceiver`` and receives all the uifees. As a result, the system cannot collect uifee, loss of revenue.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
``uiFeeReceiver``  should be a system variable that can be assigned only by a DAO, or multi-sig contract.
