# An order keeper can bypass the Keys.cancelDepositFeatureDisabledKey of the DepositHandler and cancel a deposit request via calling DepositHandler.createDeposit()!

## Summary
An order keeper can bypass the ``Keys.cancelDepositFeatureDisabledKey`` of the``DepositHandler`` and cancel a deposit request via calling ``DepositHandler.createDeposit()`` The main problem is, when the exception handling of ``DepositHandler.executeDeposit()`` will call  ``DepositUtils.cancelDeposit()`` without checking whether  ``Keys.cancelDepositFeatureDisabledKey`` is on!

## Vulnerability Detail
DepositHandler#cancelDeposit() allows a user to cancel a deposit request, but only when ``Keys.cancelDepositFeatureDisabledKey`` is off (see L69). 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/DepositHandler.sol#L63-L87](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/DepositHandler.sol#L63-L87)

However, this can be bypassed by a order keeper by calling ``DepositHandler.executeDeposit()`` - when there is some failure, the function will call ``_handleDepositError()`` at L108. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/DepositHandler.sol#L92-L114](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/DepositHandler.sol#L92-L114)

``_handleDepositError()`` might call ``DepositUtilities.cancelDeposit()`` to cancel the deposit without even checking whether ``Keys.cancelDepositFeatureDisabledKey`` is on or off. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/DepositHandler.sol#L179-L206](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/DepositHandler.sol#L179-L206)

As a result, a deposit request might be cancelled even though ``Keys.cancelDepositFeatureDisabledKey`` is on.

The following POC code confirms my finding:
1.  ``Keys.cancelDepositFeatureDisabledKey`` was turned on.  ``_dataStore.setBool(Keys.cancelDepositFeatureDisabledKey(address(_depositHandler)), true);``
2.  Regular call of ``DepositHandler.executeDeposit()`` failed due to the feature ``Keys.cancelDepositFeatureDisabledKey`` is on. 
3. But the deposit request is successfully canceled by calling ``DepositHandler.executeDeposit()`` - the deposit is not executed, but there is some error, and then the error processing function ``_handleDepositError()`` cancel the deposit despite ``Keys.cancelDepositFeatureDisabledKey`` is on. 

## Impact
An order keeper can bypass the ``Keys.cancelDepositFeatureDisabledKey`` of the ``DepositHandler`` and cancel a deposit request via calling ``DepositHandler.createDeposit()``!

## Recommendation
Check ``Keys.cancelDepositFeatureDisabledKey`` before calling ``DepositUtilities.cancelDeposit()`` inside the ``_handleDepositError()`` function.
