# Inadequate Contract Existence Check in PayableMulticall Contract

## Summary
At [LINE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/utils/PayableMulticall.sol#L22)

The `PayableMulticall` contract does not include a contract existence check before executing `delegatecall` to the target address. This could lead to unintended behavior or reverts if an invalid or non-contract address is provided as the target.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `PayableMulticall` contract executes `delegatecall` without verifying whether the target address is a valid contract. This omission leaves the contract vulnerable to potential issues when calling unknown or non-contract addresses.

## Impact
The absence of a contract existence check in the `PayableMulticall` contract could result in the following risks:

Execution of `delegatecall` on an invalid or non-contract address, leading to unexpected behavior or revert.
Loss of user funds if the `delegatecall` is mistakenly performed on an address that does not implement a fallback function.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "../error/ErrorUtils.sol";

abstract contract PayableMulticall {
    function multicall(bytes[] calldata data) external payable virtual returns (bytes[] memory results) {
        results = new bytes[](data.length);

        for (uint256 i; i < data.length; i++) {
            (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);

            if (!success) {
                ErrorUtils.revertWithParsedMessage(result);
            }

            results[i] = result;
        }

        return results;
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to include a contract existence check before executing `delegatecall` in the `PayableMulticall` contract. This can be achieved by using the `extcodesize` opcode to verify that the target address contains a valid contract. By implementing this check, the contract can prevent unintended behavior, potential reverts, and mitigate the risk of loss of user funds.

Here's an updated version of the `PayableMulticall` contract with a contract existence check before executing `delegatecall`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: BUSL-1.1

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "../error/ErrorUtils.sol";

abstract contract PayableMulticall {
    /**
     * @dev Internal function to check if an address is a valid contract.
     * @param target The address to check.
     * @return A boolean value indicating whether the address is a valid contract.
     */
    function isContract(address target) internal view returns (bool) {
        uint256 size;
        assembly {
            size := extcodesize(target)
        }
        return size > 0;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Receives and executes a batch of function calls on this contract.
     */
    function multicall(bytes[] calldata data) external payable virtual returns (bytes[] memory results) {
        results = new bytes[](data.length);

        for (uint256 i; i < data.length; i++) {
            address target = address(this);
            bytes memory callData = data[i];

            if (!isContract(target)) {
                revert("Invalid target address");
            }

            (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.delegatecall(callData);

            if (!success) {
                ErrorUtils.revertWithParsedMessage(result);
            }

            results[i] = result;
        }

        return results;
    }
}
```
