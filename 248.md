# Full impact discounts aren't given if the trigger price can't fulfill the order

## Summary

If the oracle price is used to calculate the execution price, the calculated price doesn't give the user the full impact credit they deserve


## Vulnerability Detail

If the [trigger price](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/BaseOrderUtils.sol#L353-L379) can be used to execute the order, the fully-adjusted price is returned, but if the oracle price is used, the user only gets a discount up to their acceptable price, and the rest is ignored.


## Impact

Users using acceptable prices that are better than the trigger price (in order to ensure they only execute when they get a discount), won't get the full impact discounts they deserve.


## Code Snippet

Unlike the trigger price case, the `acceptablePrice` is returned, rather than the fully-discounted `price`:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/BaseOrderUtils.sol : BaseOrderUtils.getExecutionPrice()   #1

381            // if the order could not be fulfilled using the triggerPrice
382            // check if the best oracle price can fulfill the order
383            price = customIndexTokenPrice.pickPrice(!shouldUseMaxPrice);
384    
385            // adjust price by price impact
386            if (sizeDeltaUsd > 0) {
387                price = price * Calc.sumReturnUint256(sizeDeltaUsd, priceImpactUsdForPriceAdjustment) / sizeDeltaUsd;
388            }
389    
390            if (shouldPriceBeSmaller && price <= acceptablePrice) {
391 @>             return acceptablePrice;
392            }
393    
394            if (!shouldPriceBeSmaller && price >= acceptablePrice) {
395 @>             return acceptablePrice;
396:           }
```

## Recommendation

Return `price` rather than `acceptablePrice`
