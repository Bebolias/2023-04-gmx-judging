# XDZIBEC-Vulnerability in FeatureUtils Library Allows Attackers to Enable Disabled Features

## Summary

 There is a vulnerability exists in the `validateFeature` function of the `FeatureUtils` library. This vulnerability allows an attacker to `bypass` the `validateFeature` function and `enable` a `disabled` feature.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
 function isFeatureDisabled(DataStore dataStore, bytes32 key) internal view returns (bool) {
        return dataStore.getBool(key);
    }

    // @dev validate whether a feature is enabled, reverts if the feature is disabled
    // @param dataStore DataStore
    // @param key the feature key
    function validateFeature(DataStore dataStore, bytes32 key) internal view {
        if (isFeatureDisabled(dataStore, key)) {
            revert Errors.DisabledFeature(key);
        }
    }
}
```
the vulnerability in the` isFeatureDisabled` function. The function returns a `boolean` value indicating whether the feature is disabled or not, the function does not check to see if the `dataStore` variable is null. This means that if `dataStore` is null, the function will return `false`, even if the `feature` is actually disabled.
 it allows an attacker to `bypass` the `validateFeature` function and `enable` a `disabled` feature. This could be used to perform `malicious` actions, such as `stealing funds` from a smart contract.

## Impact

-if an attacker exploit this vulnerability is leading  to gain unauthorized access.
-An attacker can `bypass` the `validateFeature` function and `enable` a `disabled` feature. This could be used to perform `malicious` actions, such as `stealing funds` from a smart contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

the `isFeatureDisabled` function should check to see if `dataStore` is `null` before returning a value. This can be done by adding the following line of code in the beginning of the function:

```solidity
require(dataStore != null);
```
