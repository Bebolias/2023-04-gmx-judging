# usdToMarketTokenAmount() does not work for market tokens of not 18 decimals.

## Summary
usdToMarketTokenAmount() does not work for market tokens of not 18 decimals. 

## Vulnerability Detail
``usdToMarketTokenAmount()`` is used to convert  a USD value to number of market tokens. The USD value is assumed to be in float precision, that is 1 dollar = 1e30. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L2068-L2079](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L2068-L2079)

When ``(supply == 0 || poolValue == 0)``, each dollar will be converted into one unit of market token ``1*marketToken.decimals()``. 
However, the function fails to consider the number of decimals for the market token, and assumes that it has 18 decimals and use function ``Precision.floatToWei(usdValue)`` to scale the value. As a result, it does not work for market tokens that have different number of decimals. 

## Impact
usdToMarketTokenAmount() does not work for market tokens of not 18 decimals.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Reimplement usdToMarketTokenAmount() so that it can work for market tokens that have decimal number other than 18.
