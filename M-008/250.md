# No UI fee paid for ADL orders even though referral fees are paid for those orders

## Summary

UI fees aren't paid for ADL orders even though referral fees are paid for those orders


## Vulnerability Detail

No UI fee receiver is set for ADL orders, which means the fee is not assessed.


## Impact

Loss of fees to the UI, which appears to be a passthrough mechanism to allow other exchanges/contracts to provide order flow for a fee.

Liquidation orders have the same issue, but appear to be specifically [excluded](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.sol#L342-L343), and it's not clear whether the UI fee was intended to be included in that exclusion.


## Code Snippet

No UI fee receiver is set for ADL orders:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/adl/AdlUtils.sol : AdlUtils.createAdlOrder()   #1

141            Order.Addresses memory addresses = Order.Addresses(
142                params.account, // account
143                params.account, // receiver
144                address(0), // callbackContract
145 @>             address(0), // uiFeeReceiver
146                params.market, // market
147                position.collateralToken(), // initialCollateralToken
148                new address[](0) // swapPath
149:           );
```

which means none are [charged](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/pricing/PositionPricingUtils.sol#L505-L509).


## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Store and retrieve the UI fee receiver in the same way as is done for the referral fees
