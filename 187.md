# XDZIBEC-InvalidClaimFeesInput error is not handled properly in the claimFees() function

## Summary

There is a vulnerability is in the `revert` statement. the `claimFees()` function  is not properly handling the `InvalidClaimFeesInput` `error`. If this error occurs, the `fees` will still be `transferred` to the `receiver` address, even though the `error has occurred`
If an attacker is able to exploit the vulnerability, they could drain the fees from the specified markets. This could result in a significant loss of funds for the users.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function claimFees(
        address[] memory markets,
        address[] memory tokens
    ) external nonReentrant onlyFeeKeeper {
        if (markets.length != tokens.length) {
            revert Errors.InvalidClaimFeesInput(markets.length, tokens.length);
        }

        address receiver = dataStore.getAddress(Keys.FEE_RECEIVER);

        for (uint256 i; i < markets.length; i++) {
            FeeUtils.claimFees(
                dataStore,
                eventEmitter,
                markets[i],
                tokens[i],
                receiver
            );
        }
    }
}
```

The `revert` statement is used to cancel the execution of a function and return all of the state changes to their previous state. so, the revert statement in the` claimFees()` function is not properly handling the `InvalidClaimFeesInput` error.
The `InvalidClaimFeesInput` error is an error that occurs when the number of markets and `tokens` do not match. If this error occurs, the` claimFees()` function should `revert` all of the state changes, including the transfer of `fees` to the `receiver` address., the `revert` statement in the `claimFees()` function only `reverts` the state changes up to the point of the `error`. This means that the `fees` will still be `transferred` to the `receiver` address, even if the `InvalidClaimFeesInput` error occurs.


## Impact

-it could damage the reputation of the contract if an attacker exploit the vulnerability cause it's going to make users  loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- update the `revert` statement in the `claimFees()` function to include this code as an example:
```solidity
  revert Errors.InvalidClaimFeesInput(markets.length, tokens.length);
```
This will `revert` all of the state changes, including the `transfer` of fees to the `receiver` address.
