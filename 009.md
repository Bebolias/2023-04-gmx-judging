# No Input Validation on `minOutputAmount`

## Summary

There is no input validation for the `minOutputAmount` parameter in the `swap` function, which may lead to unintended consequences.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `swap` function takes a `minOutputAmount` parameter that specifies the minimum amount of tokens the user expects to receive. However, there is no validation to ensure that the value provided is greater than zero. This could potentially lead to a scenario where a user unintentionally sets the minimum output amount to zero, which could cause the swap to execute with a lower than intended return.

## Impact

If a user accidentally sets the `minOutputAmount` parameter to zero or an incorrect value, they might receive a lower return than expected, which could result in financial loss.

## Recommendation

Add input validation for the `minOutputAmount` parameter in the `swap` function to ensure that the provided value is greater than zero. This will help protect users from potential financial loss due to unintended low minimum output amounts.
