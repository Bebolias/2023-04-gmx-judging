# `ReferralUtils.sol#setTraderReferralCode`  can be exploited to zore risk trade

## Summary

A certain `totalRebateAmount` will be paid for each trade, and this rate can be updated by the user at any time by creating an order. As a result, users can manipulate `fees.collateralCostAmount` at any time to control whether the order to be executed is successfully executed.

## Vulnerability Detail

`ReferralCode` can be updated at any time by [creating an order](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/OrderUtils.sol#L56), and the `ReferralCodes` [determines `totalRebate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/referral/ReferralUtils.sol#L73-L99).

The `totalRebate` can [control the `traderDiscountAmount` and `affiliateRewardAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/pricing/PositionPricingUtils.sol#L550-L552). Further [affects `fees.totalNetCostAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/pricing/PositionPricingUtils.sol#L433).

The `fees.totalNetCostAmount` can control whether the order to be executed is successfully executed, for example [make `remainingCollateralAmount` insufficient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.sol#L224-L226).

## Impact

Users can control whether the order to be executed is successful to conduct zero-risk trade.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to use `RebateFactor` as an input parameter to create an order and cannot be updated at any time
