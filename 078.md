# Functions marked as payable do not account for ethers sent with Calls

## Summary:Analysis of a Payable Function Without Ether Handling

## Vulnerability Detail:Many functions in ExchangeRouter.sol are marked as payable but ether  are all unaccounted for .Payable functions are typically used to receive and handle incoming ether transactions. However, the absence of ether handling within such a function raises concerns regarding the potential implications for the contract's functionality and security .This  means  users that transfer ethers with calls has no way of recovering back their  ether .Diving deeper into the code i noticed that these functions lack  ether handling processes.
## Impact:This could lead to different misconceptions of the functionality of these functions or the contract as a whole

## Code Snippet:https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/06ccd8c7ee4cadc46e3ac412dcf141eefdced42f/gmx-synthetics/contracts/router/ExchangeRouter.sol#L168


## Tool used:Nano 

Manual Review

## Recommendation:Remove payable flags if the contract is not meant to handle ether or add ether handling processes
