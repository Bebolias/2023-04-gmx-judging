# Ether sent with calls cannot be withdrawn

## Summary:Stucked Tokens in the contract

## Vulnerability Detail:Many functions in ExchangeRouter.sol are marked as payable but ether  are all unaccounted for so it means users could transfer ether with calls and there is no way to remove ether in the contract and the ether transferred are also unaccounted.

## Impact:This could lead to distrust  in the protocol reputation especially nowadays it is very difficult to gain trust in  projects because of scams and hacks and  users would not be satisfied with sending tokens  with calls and the sent tokens cannot be retrieved or accounted for.

## Code Snippet:https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/router/ExchangeRouter.sol#LL186C1


## Tool used:Nano 

Manual Review

## Recommendation:Remove payable flags if the contract is not meant to handle ether or account for the ether being transferred and a withdrawal mechanism to remove Ether.
