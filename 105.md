# Wrong formula to calculate the price impact

## Summary
Wrong formula used to calculate price impact

## Vulnerability Detail

In the docs it is clearly stated that the formula used to calculate the price impact is:

```solidity

The code for price impact can be found in the `/pricing` contracts.
Price impact is calculated as:


(initial USD difference) ^ (price impact exponent) * (price impact factor / 2) - (next USD difference) ^ (price impact exponent) * (price impact factor / 2)
```
though there is nowhere in the codebase used, the actual formula to calculate the price impact is different to the stated on the docs.
