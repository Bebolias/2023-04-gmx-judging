# If a token's oracle goes down or price falls to zero, liquidations will be frozen

## Summary
In some extreme cases, oracles can be taken offline or token prices can fall to zero. In these cases, liquidations will be frozen (all calls will revert) for any debt holders holding this token, even though they may be some of the most important times to allow liquidations to retain the solvency of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink has taken oracles offline in extreme cases. For example, during the UST collapse, Chainlink paused the UST/ETH price oracle, to ensure that it wasn't providing inaccurate data to protocols.

In such a situation (or one in which the token's value falls to zero), all liquidations for users holding the frozen asset would revert. This is because any call to liquidate() calls isLiquidatable(), which calls getPositionRisk(), which calls the oracle to get the values of all the position's tokens (underlying, debt, and collateral).

Depending on the specifics, one of the following checks would cause the revert:

the call to Chainlink's registry.latestRoundData would fail
if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime) revert PRICE_OUTDATED(_token);
if (px == 0) revert PRICE_FAILED(token);
If the oracle price lookup reverts, liquidations will be frozen, and the user will be immune to liquidations. Although there are ways this could be manually fixed with fake oracles, by definition this happening would represent a cataclysmic time where liquidations need to be happening promptly to avoid the protocol falling into insolvency.

## Impact
Liquidations may not be possible at a time when the protocol needs them most. As a result, the value of user's asset may fall below their debts, turning off any liquidation incentive and pushing the protocol into insolvency.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use try/catch block. The logic for getting the token's price from the Chainlink data feed should be placed in the try block, while some fallback logic when the access to the chainlink oracle data feed is denied should be placed in the catch block. E.g:

```solidity
function getPrice(address priceFeedAddress) external view returns (int256) {
        try AggregatorV3Interface(priceFeedAddress).latestRoundData() returns (
            uint80,         // roundID
            int256 price,   // price
            uint256,        // startedAt
            uint256,        // timestamp
            uint80          // answeredInRound
        ) {
            return price;
        } catch Error(string memory) {            
            // handle failure here:
            // revert, call propietary fallback oracle, fetch from another 3rd-party oracle, etc.
        }
    }
```
