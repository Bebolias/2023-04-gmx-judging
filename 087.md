# MAX_TIMELOCK_DELAY is not enforced inside the constructor of the timelock

## Summary
The ```MAX_TIMELOCK_DELAY``` of 5 days is not enforced inside the constructor. If due to an intentional or unintentional misconfiguration in the deployment process this gets set to a high value, then all features behind the timelock will become permanently locked. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The timelock contracts constructor does not properly validate that the passed timelockDelay is less than the MAX_TIMELOCK_DELAY. Therefore, an arbitrarily large timelockDelay can be passed and lead to the rest of the contract functionality becoming useless.
```solidity
    uint256 public constant MAX_TIMELOCK_DELAY = 5 days;
    constructor(
        RoleStore _roleStore,
        DataStore _dataStore,
        EventEmitter _eventEmitter,
        OracleStore _oracleStore,
        uint256 _timelockDelay
    ) RoleModule(_roleStore) {
        dataStore = _dataStore;
        eventEmitter = _eventEmitter;
        oracleStore = _oracleStore;
        timelockDelay = _timelockDelay;
    }
```

## Impact
Though the odds of this are low, the worst-case scenario results in the Timelock period being set arbitrarily large and all features behind it becoming permanently locked and unusable. Locked features include setting the fee receiver, changing roles (besides the multisig method), and setting oracle related variables. Since the timelock contract offers no method to reduce the timelock delay (only increase), the contract will be stuck permanently. 
```solidity
    function increaseTimelockDelay(uint256 _timelockDelay) external onlyTimelockAdmin nonReentrant {
       //@audit attempts to decrease the delay will revert
        if (_timelockDelay <= timelockDelay) {
            revert Errors.InvalidTimelockDelay(_timelockDelay);
        }
        //@audit here the max timelock delay is enforced properly
        if (_timelockDelay > MAX_TIMELOCK_DELAY) {
            revert Errors.MaxTimelockDelayExceeded(_timelockDelay);
        }

        timelockDelay = _timelockDelay;
    }
```
A likely scenario is the contract is deployed with the intent of setting  _timelockDelay to 1 day (86400 seconds) but the deployer accidentally enters 864000(10 days) instead. This results in the timelock period being set to twice the desired possible maximum.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Inside the constructor, either revert if the passed _timelockDelay is greater than the MAX_TIMELOCK_DELAY or set the new timelockDelay to MAX_TIMELOCK_DELAY if it is greater than  MAX_TIMELOCK_DELAY.
