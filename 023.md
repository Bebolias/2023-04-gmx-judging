# Lack of Input Validation for `setAddress`

## Summary

The `setAddress` function does not validate its input, which allows setting an address to the zero address (0x0), causing potential issues in the contract's operation.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `setAddress` function, there is no check to ensure that the provided address is not the zero address. This could lead to unintentional or malicious setting of important addresses to the zero address, causing failures in contract functionality.

## Impact

Setting critical addresses to the zero address may cause the contract to malfunction, as certain operations may not be carried out with the zero address. This could lead to funds being locked, loss of functionality, or other unintended consequences.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add input validation to check if the provided address is not the zero address:

```solidity
require(value != address(0), "Address must not be the zero address");
```

This check should be placed inside the `setAddress` function after the `_validateKey(baseKey)` call. This would ensure that critical addresses are not accidentally or maliciously set to the zero address, preventing potential issues in the contract's operation.
