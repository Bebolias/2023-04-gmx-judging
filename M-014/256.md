# Virtual inventory for swaps is not tracked properly when long/short collateral are the same

## Summary

Virtual inventory for swaps is not tracked properly for markets where the long and short collateral tokens are the same, and the virtual inventory keys are the same


## Vulnerability Detail

Markets where the same token is used for collateral aren't allowed to be used for swaps, but those same markets are able to skew the balance of virtual inventory, which affects impacts of the current market as well as other markets.


## Impact

If a user withdraws from such a market, the virtual swap token balance will decrease, likely causing more negative impacts for the other market even though the market the withdrawal was made from in didn't allow swaps, so their removal of liquidity should have had no effect.


## Code Snippet

One cannot swap through a market where the collateral tokens are the same:

```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol : MarketUtils.validateSwapMarket()   #1

210        function validateSwapMarket(Market.Props memory market) internal pure {
211            if (market.longToken == market.shortToken) {
212 @>             revert Errors.InvalidSwapMarket(market.marketToken);
213            }
214:       }
```

But withdrawing affects [the](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L701-L721
) [balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1471-L1491):
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/withdrawal/WithdrawalUtils.sol : WithdrawalUtils._executeWithdrawal()   #2

339            cache.shortTokenOutputAmount = cache.shortTokenFees.amountAfterFees;
340    
341 @>         MarketUtils.applyDeltaToPoolAmount(
342                params.dataStore,
343                params.eventEmitter,
344                market.marketToken,
345                market.longToken,
346                -cache.longTokenPoolAmountDelta.toInt256()
347            );
348    
349 @>         MarketUtils.applyDeltaToPoolAmount(
350                params.dataStore,
351                params.eventEmitter,
352                market.marketToken,
353                market.shortToken,
354                -cache.shortTokenPoolAmountDelta.toInt256()
355:           );

As do other operations such as [depositing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L318-L338), applying [PnL](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionUtils.sol#L273-L293), and applying [fees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/IncreasePositionUtils.sol#L260-L279)


## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Don't call `applyDeltaToVirtualInventoryForSwaps()` if the market is not swappable
