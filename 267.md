# isPositionLiquidatable should use max collateral prices in fees cost calculation

## Summary
The codebase follows a general theme of using ```collateralTokenPrice.max``` for calculating borrowingFees etc. and ```collateralTokenPrice.min``` for estimating remaining collateral etc. However, at one place while checking if the Position is Liquidatable, ```collateralPrice.min``` is used for calculating Fees cost.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ```isPositionLiquidatable``` function checks if a position is bound to be liquidated. This function is called via ```validatePosition``` when increasing or Decreasing Position etc. This function calculates the position collateral, price impact, PnL and fees cost to calculate the final adjusted collateral amount and check if its smaller than the ```MIN_COLLATERAL_USD```. This is done to validate that the final position collateral amounts (if this current position change order were to be executed) obey the liquidation limits. The call flow is decreasePosition => validatePosition => isPositionLiquidatable

```solidity
 cache.remainingCollateralUsd =
            cache.collateralUsd.toInt256()
            + cache.positionPnlUsd
            + cache.priceImpactUsd
            - collateralCostUsd.toInt256();

        if (shouldValidateMinCollateralUsd) {
            cache.minCollateralUsd = dataStore.getUint(Keys.MIN_COLLATERAL_USD).toInt256();
            if (cache.remainingCollateralUsd < cache.minCollateralUsd) {
                return true;
            }
        }
```

Here the point of concern is how the ```collateralCostUsd``` is calculated. 
```solidity
uint256 collateralCostUsd = fees.collateralCostAmount * cache.collateralTokenPrice.min;
```
Since the collateral cost has to be subtracted from position collateral value to calculate final ```remainingCollateralUsd```, and this ```remainingCollateralUsd``` is then checked against ```MIN_COLLATERAL_USD``` to validate the change in the position through this order, so we should be using max price value for properly liquidating positions that are possibly liquidatable with max collateral prices.
Everywhere in the codebase, the fees is calculated as maximized. For eg => [PositionPricingUtils.sol#L513](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/06ccd8c7ee4cadc46e3ac412dcf141eefdced42f/gmx-synthetics/contracts/pricing/PositionPricingUtils.sol#L513), [PositionPricingUtils.sol#L548](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/06ccd8c7ee4cadc46e3ac412dcf141eefdced42f/gmx-synthetics/contracts/pricing/PositionPricingUtils.sol#L548)


## Impact
The use of ```collateralTokenPrice.min``` underestimates the ```collateralCostUsd``` (the Fees cost) and thus may allow {-positions deserving to be liquidated when max prices are used for calculating actual fees during execution -} to get validated. This way some positions will bypass the ```MIN_COLLATERAL_USD``` check because of lower bound of collateralTokenPrice being used.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace ```cache.collateralUsd = position.collateralAmount() * cache.collateralTokenPrice.min;
```  by  ```cache.collateralUsd = position.collateralAmount() * cache.collateralTokenPrice.max;```
