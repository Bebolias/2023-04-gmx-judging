# no last-resort user-driven executeWithdrawal entry as a permissionless protocol

## Summary
no last-resort user-driven executeWithdrawal entry as a permissionless protocol

## Vulnerability Detail
right now executeWithdrawal can only be called by keeper. This is not ideal since in the worst situation where keeper either collude or get malfunctional, users do not have a way to force-trigger an execution of withdrawal from the protocol. This is quite concerning as an dapp, since some other solution like for example dydx, has a [force withdrawal mechanism](https://help.dydx.exchange/en/articles/5108558-withdrawing-funds-from-layer-2) for user to enforce fund protection

## Impact
user lack last-resort method to protect their funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
include a way for user to force executeWithdrawal, either when their cancelWithdrawal requests get stale (some threshold), or they are willing to take a bigger cut/slippage under extreme circumstance.
