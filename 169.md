# XDZIBEC-IDepositCallbackReceiver interface allows attackers to call afterDepositExecution() function

## Summary

There is a vulnerability in the `afterDepositExecution()` function in the `IDepositCallbackReceiver` interface is declared as `external`, which means that it can be called from another contract. This allows an attacker to create a contract that implements the `IDepositCallbackReceiver` interface and then call the `afterDepositExecution()` function from their contract. This could be used to steal funds or perform other malicious actions.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function afterDepositExecution(bytes32 key, Deposit.Props memory deposit) external;

    // @dev called after a deposit cancellation
    // @param key the key of the deposit
    // @param deposit the deposit that was cancelled
    function afterDepositCancellation(bytes32 key, Deposit.Props memory deposit) external;
}
```

The `afterDepositExecution()` function in the` IDepositCallbackReceiver` interface is responsible for performing actions after a `deposit` has been `executed`,so `afterDepositExecution()` function is declared as `external`. This means that the function can be `called` from another contract, this means that if an attacker creates a contract that implements the `IDepositCallbackReceiver` interface, the attacker can call the `afterDepositExecution()` function from their contract. This could be used to steal` funds` or `perform` other malicious actions.


## Impact

-the vulnerability is allows an attacker to steal funds or perform other malicious actions. The attacker could call the `afterDepositExecution()` function to transfer `funds` from the `victim's` account to the `attacker's` account.
-if an attacker  exploit the vulnerability, they could steal a large amount of `funds` from `users`. This could damage the `reputation` of the `protocol` and discourage `users` from using it.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

-The `afterDepositExecution()` function should be declared as `internal` instead of `external`.
-The documentation for the `afterDepositExecution()` function should be `updated` to include a `warning` about the security implications of `declaring` the function as `external`.
