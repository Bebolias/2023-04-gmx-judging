# the first increasePosition execution in the protocol does not trigger update of funding rate even when it should

## Summary
the first increasePosition execution in the protocol does not trigger update of funding rate even it should 

## Vulnerability Detail
On the very first call to increasePosition, it calls `IncreasePositionUtils.IncreasePosition` which call `PositionUtils.updateFundingAndBorrowingState` before the update of Open Interest. 

Consider a case:
1. Open Interest: Long: 100 Short 0
2. Trade comes in to open a short of 1000

call stack:
PositionUtils.updateFundingAndBorrowingState =>
MarketUtils.updateFundingAmountPerSize =>
MarketUtils.getNextFundingAmountPerSize

since at this point the open interest of the short side is 0, the trader who comes in with a short order execution would early exit getNextFundingAmountPerSize. Until the next trade comes in, this trade does not pay funding fee.

```solidity
        // if either long or short open interest is zero, then funding should not be updated
        // as there would not be any user to pay the funding to
        if (cache.oi.longOpenInterest == 0 || cache.oi.shortOpenInterest == 0) {
            return result;
        }
```


## Impact
first trader who trade from an OI of 0 doesnt pay funding fee.
