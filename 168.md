# a different positive/negative impact factor would still lead to potential advantage for immediate open/close position

## Summary
a different positive/negative impact factor would still lead to potential advantage for immediate open/close position

## Vulnerability Detail

Under function `getAdjustedPositionImpactFactors`, there is some consideration on having a different impact factor for positive and negative move. And this function is used for getting price impact for crossoverRebalance. However, consider a case like this:

1. Current Open interest: Long 100 Short 0, Open Interest diff = 100
2. Trader comes open a long of 1000; moving the open interest delta from 100 to 1100. He pays price impact.
3. Trader immediately open a short of 1000, moving the open interest delta from 1100 back to 100.

In both calculation of 2 and 3, the magnitude of price impact is the same under the current calculation. And both of trades fall below the "SameSideRebalance" bucket. However if the positive impact factor is bigger than the negative impact factor; then the additional cost the trader pays at 2.) may be smaller than the price impact benefit that he receives at 3, incentivising him to game the system.

getAdjustedPositionImpactFactors
```solidity
        // if the positive impact factor is more than the negative impact factor, positions could be opened
        // and closed immediately for a profit if the difference is sufficient to cover the position fees
        if (positiveImpactFactor > negativeImpactFactor) {
            positiveImpactFactor = negativeImpactFactor;
        }
```

_getPriceImpactUsd
```solidity

        } else {
            (uint256 positiveImpactFactor, uint256 negativeImpactFactor) = MarketUtils.getAdjustedPositionImpactFactors(dataStore, market);

            return PricingUtils.getPriceImpactUsdForCrossoverRebalance(
                initialDiffUsd,
                nextDiffUsd,
                positiveImpactFactor,
                negativeImpactFactor,
                impactExponentFactor

_getPriceImpactUsd
```solidity
    function _getPriceImpactUsd(DataStore dataStore, Market.Props memory market, PoolParams memory poolParams) internal view returns (int256) {
        uint256 initialDiffUsd = Calc.diff(poolParams.poolUsdForTokenA, poolParams.poolUsdForTokenB);
        uint256 nextDiffUsd = Calc.diff(poolParams.nextPoolUsdForTokenA, poolParams.nextPoolUsdForTokenB);

        // check whether an improvement in balance comes from causing the balance to switch sides
        // for example, if there is $2000 of ETH and $1000 of USDC in the pool
        // adding $1999 USDC into the pool will reduce absolute balance from $1000 to $999 but it does not
        // help rebalance the pool much, the isSameSideRebalance value helps avoid gaming using this case
        bool isSameSideRebalance = (poolParams.poolUsdForTokenA <= poolParams.poolUsdForTokenB) == (poolParams.nextPoolUsdForTokenA <= poolParams.nextPoolUsdForTokenB);
        uint256 impactExponentFactor = dataStore.getUint(Keys.swapImpactExponentFactorKey(market.marketToken));

        if (isSameSideRebalance) {
            bool hasPositiveImpact = nextDiffUsd < initialDiffUsd;
            uint256 impactFactor = MarketUtils.getAdjustedSwapImpactFactor(dataStore, market.marketToken, hasPositiveImpact);

            return PricingUtils.getPriceImpactUsdForSameSideRebalance(
                initialDiffUsd,
                nextDiffUsd,
                impactFactor,
                impactExponentFactor
            );
        } else {
            (uint256 positiveImpactFactor, uint256 negativeImpactFactor) = MarketUtils.getAdjustedSwapImpactFactors(dataStore, market.marketToken);

            return PricingUtils.getPriceImpactUsdForCrossoverRebalance(
                initialDiffUsd,
                nextDiffUsd,
                positiveImpactFactor,
                negativeImpactFactor,
                impactExponentFactor
            );
        }
    }

## Recommendation
Consider enforce the same impact factor for both positive and negative impact, if not a smaller positive impact factor. for both crossoverRebalance and sameSideRebalance
