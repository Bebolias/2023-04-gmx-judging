# XDZIBEC-CallbackUtils library does not check whether the callback contract implements the expected interface

## Summary

There is a vulnerability in  `isValidCallbackContract()`  function in the `CallbackUtils` library it does not check whether the `callback` contract implements the expected interface. this allows an attacker to `create` a `contract` that implements the `expected` interface and then `set` this contract as the `callback` contract for a `deposit`. When the `deposit` is `executed`, the attacker's  `contract` would be called, even though it is not the original `contract` that was intended to be `called`.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
// @dev validates that the given address is a contract
    // @param callbackContract the contract to call
    function isValidCallbackContract(address callbackContract) internal view returns (bool) {
        if (callbackContract == address(0)) { return false; }
        if (!callbackContract.isContract()) { return false; }

        return true;
    }
}
```
the `isValidCallbackContract()` function checks whether the given` address` is a contract. However, the function does not check whether the contract is actually the `type` of contract that is expected by the` callback function`.

For example, the` afterDepositExecution()` function expects the `callback` contract to implement the `IDepositCallbackReceiver` interface. the` isValidCallbackContract()` function does not check whether the `callback` contract actually implements this interface.
This means that an attacker could create a `contract `that implements the` IDepositCallbackReceiver` interface and then set this `contract` as the `callback` `contract` for a `deposit`. When the `deposit` is `executed`, the attacker's `contract` would be called, even though it is not the original `contract` that was intended to be` called`.


Here is an example how to fix the vulnerability

```solidity
function isValidCallbackContract(address callbackContract) internal view returns (bool) {
    if (callbackContract == address(0)) { return false; }
    if (!callbackContract.isContract()) { return false; }

    // Check whether the callback contract implements the expected interface.
    bool isExpectedInterface = false;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < callbackContract.interfaceCount(); i++) {
        if (callbackContract.isInterfaceImplemented(i, type(IDepositCallbackReceiver))) {
            isExpectedInterface = true;
            break;
        }
    }

    return isExpectedInterface;
}
```

-the `isValidCallbackContract()` function now checks whether the `callback `contract implements the expected interface. This prevents an attacker from creating a contract that does not implement the expected interface and then setting this contract as the `callback` contract.

## Impact

-an attacker could  steal funds or perform other malicious actions from this vulnerability

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

-The` isValidCallbackContract()` function should be updated to check whether the contract implements the expected interface.
-The documentation for the` isValidCallbackContract()` function should be updated to include a warning about the security implications of not checking whether the contract implements the expected interface.
