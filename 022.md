# Missing input validation in MarketFactory for marketType

## Summary

In the `createMarket` function of the MarketFactory contract, there is no input validation for the `marketType` parameter. An empty or invalid marketType can be passed, which could cause issues in future updates or integrations.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `marketType` parameter in the `createMarket` function is not validated or checked for emptiness or validity.

## Impact

Although the `marketType` is not stored with the market, it is used to ensure that markets with the same indexToken, longToken, and shortToken can be created if needed. If an invalid or empty marketType is passed, it could cause issues in future updates or integrations where the marketType plays a more significant role.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add input validation for the `marketType` parameter in the `createMarket` function. You could require that `marketType` is not empty and consider creating a predefined set of valid market types to ensure that only valid market types are used when creating markets:

```solidity
require(marketType != bytes32(0), "Market type must not be empty");
```

Additionally, you may create a mapping to store valid market types and check against it when creating a market:

```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => bool) public validMarketTypes;

function createMarket(
    address indexToken,
    address longToken,
    address shortToken,
    bytes32 marketType
) external onlyMarketKeeper returns (Market.Props memory) {
    require(validMarketTypes[marketType], "Invalid market type");
    ...
}
```

Ensure that you initialize the `validMarketTypes` mapping with the appropriate market types during contract deployment or through an initialization function. This approach helps maintain a clear and valid set of market types and reduces the likelihood of issues in future updates or integrations.
