# Incorrect calculation of gasLimit for every order type

## Summary
Having the same gas estimation constants for every order type does calculate improperly the execution fee for keepers, either refunding less or charging more to the user, depending on the order type

## Vulnerability Detail

Currently the calculation of the gasLimit for different types of orders it is calculated in `gasUtils.sol` . As pointed in the snippet below, the three calculations use the same formula to calculate the repectives gasLimits

The problem, is that the keys like `increaseOrderGasLimitKey` are all the same according to the tests. Meaning that they are assigning the same exact gasLimit to all types of orders.

This misscalculates the minExecution fee:

making pay more to the end user or refunding less to keepers, depending on the order type

## Impact
Loss of funds for either the keeper or user by paying more or less execution fees depending on the order type

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make a calculation of how much the actual execution of each specific order type costs and store that as a key. Make a gas distinction between the orders according to their real gas usage to calculate the right execution fee for every order type
