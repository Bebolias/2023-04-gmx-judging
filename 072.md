# MarketUtils#getReservedUsd() overesitmated the reservedUSD for the short side.

## Summary
MarketUtils#getReservedUsd() overesitmates the reservedUSD for the short side. The problem is that it never considers the price change of the index token. Although the short tokens might be stable coins, the index tokens are not! And the reserved value should reflect the change of the price of the index tokens. For example, when the price drops, the reservedUsd should be decrease as well. 

## Vulnerability Detail
``MarketUtils#getReservedUsd()`` is to calculate the total USD value required for positions on the long/short side. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1415-L1439](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1415-L1439)

However, the function overesitmated the reservedUSD for the short side as it does not  considers the price change of the index token. 

The correct one would be 

```javascript
uint256 openInterestInTokens = getOpenInterestInTokens(dataStore, market, isLong);
uint256 openInterestValue= openInterestInTokens * prices.indexTokenPrice.max;
uint256 openInterest = getOpenInterest(dataStore, market, isLong);
return min(openInterestValue, openInterest); 
```

## Impact
MarketUtils#getReservedUsd() overesitmated the reservedUSD for the short side. The problem is that it never considers the price change of the index token. The implementation works ONLY when short tokens are stable coins.

```diff
 function getReservedUsd(
        DataStore dataStore,
        Market.Props memory market,
        MarketPrices memory prices,
        bool isLong
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 reservedUsd;
        if (isLong) {
            // for longs calculate the reserved USD based on the open interest and current indexTokenPrice
            // this works well for e.g. an ETH / USD market with long collateral token as WETH
            // the available amount to be reserved would scale with the price of ETH
            // this also works for e.g. a SOL / USD market with long collateral token as WETH
            // if the price of SOL increases more than the price of ETH, additional amounts would be
            // automatically reserved
            uint256 openInterestInTokens = getOpenInterestInTokens(dataStore, market, isLong);
            reservedUsd = openInterestInTokens * prices.indexTokenPrice.max;
        } else {
            // for shorts use the open interest as the reserved USD value
            // this works well for e.g. an ETH / USD market with short collateral token as USDC
            // the available amount to be reserved would not change with the price of ETH
            reservedUsd = getOpenInterest(dataStore, market, isLong);
+         uint256 openInterestInTokens = getOpenInterestInTokens(dataStore, market, isLong);            reservedUsd = openInterestInTokens * prices.indexTokenPrice.max;
