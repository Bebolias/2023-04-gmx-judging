# If the price changes drastically between creation and execution the trade may fail

## Summary

There is a certain time difference between the creation and execution of the trade. The keeper will use the price at the time of creation during execution. This price will be compared with the price of chainlink during execution. If the price deviation is too large, the execution will fail. This causes the user's normal high gain/loss trades to fail.

When `setPrices`, the maximum price and the minimum price will be compared with the chainlink price respectively, and revert if the deviation is too large. The signed price and chainlink price used here are at different time points, namely the creation time point and the execution time point. Large price differences at different points in time are legal, especially in the cryptocurrency scene.

## Impact

Once the price changes drastically, it means that users will have huge gains or huge losses. If the trade fails, the user's huge financial loss or profit will be caused.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to use the historical price of chainlink for comparison to make the time points of the two prices coincide
