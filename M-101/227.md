# nonRevertingTransferWithGasLimit can revert

## Summary

The function `nonRevertingTransferWithGasLimit` is used to verify that the call to it will not revert. Due to insufficiant checks, the function can revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol takes great care to make sure the function does not revert/

The vulnerabilities resides in the returned data of the transfer call.
It is important to note that with current supported tokens, they will not revert. 
The protocol mentioned that they have the restrictions set for future unknown token behvior

```solidity
    function nonRevertingTransferWithGasLimit(
        IERC20 token,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 gasLimit
    ) internal returns (bool, bytes memory) {
---------
            if (returndata.length > 0 && !abi.decode(returndata, (bool))) {
                return (false, returndata);
            }
---------
    }
```

As can be seen, the return data is decoded as a `bool`. If a non `bool` value is returned, the transaction will revert in the attempt to perform `abi.decode` - `abi.decode` reverts when trying to decode a value that does not match the type.

## Recommendation

Check that the return data matches the `bool` type before passing to `abi.decode`
