# increasePositionUtils.increasePosition() double accounts for fees.collateralCostAmount , as a result, it might consider a position is liquidable when it is actually not.

## Summary
``increasePositionUtils.increasePosition()`` double accounts for ``fees.collateralCostAmount ``, as a result, it might consider a position is liquidable when it is actually not. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the case that a trader is executing an InncreaseMarket order and execute the flow ``OrderHandler.ExecuteOrder() -> _executeOrder() -> OrderUtils.executeOrder() -> processOrder() -> IncreaseOrderUtils.processOrder() -> IncreasePositionUtils.increasePosition()`` and let's pay attention to the last function ``IncreasePositionUtils.increasePosition()``:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/IncreasePositionUtils.sol#L53-L209](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/IncreasePositionUtils.sol#L53-L209)

As we can see, ``fees.collateralCostAmount `` is accounted twice in this function: 

1) at L92, where ``fees.collateralCostAmount`` is accounted by summing ``params.position.collateralAmount()`` by ``cache.collateralDeltaAmount`` (- fees.collateralCostAmount):

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/IncreasePositionUtils.sol#L92](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/IncreasePositionUtils.sol#L92)

2) L151 when the function calls ``PositionUtils.validatePosition()-> isPositionLiquidatable()``, ``fees.collateralCostAmount`` is applied for the second time to check if the position is liquidable: 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/PositionUtils.sol#L383-L387](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/PositionUtils.sol#L383-L387)

This second application of ``fees.collateralCostAmount`` makes ``cache.remainingCollateralUsd`` smaller and thus even a position that is not liquidable yet will be considered liquidable. As a result, the trade will fail even though it is supposed to succeed. 

## Impact
``increasePositionUtils.increasePosition()`` double account for fees.collateralCostAmount , as a result, it might consider a position is liquidable when it is actually not. Then the trade will fail unnecessarily.

## Recommendation
Only apply ``fees.collateralCostAmount`` once to avoid such double accounting.
