# Lack of input validation in the Deposit library

## Summary

The Deposit library does not perform input validation on the provided addresses and amounts, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the Deposit library, setters for the 'Props' struct do not perform input validation. This could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues if invalid or malicious addresses or amounts are provided.

## Impact

Malicious actors could exploit the lack of input validation to pass invalid addresses or amounts to the Deposit library, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, security issues, or loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement input validation checks in the setters to ensure that provided addresses are valid (non-zero addresses) and amounts are within an acceptable range. Additionally, consider using the SafeERC20 library from OpenZeppelin for secure token transfers.
