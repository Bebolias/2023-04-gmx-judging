# Incorrect Adl execute order fee calculation

## Summary
Wrong gas calculation for executing orders.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `adlHandler` the gas calculated has 1 flaw. 

On the lines:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/AdlHandler.sol#L101-L103

the starting gas is calculated after loading to memory the ` ExecuteAdlCache memory cache`  which costs gas. Not accounting for it has a minimal loss of refund fees.

## Impact
Wrong gas calculation for adl execution by calculating the gas after other instructions have already been executed

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Start accounting for fees from before loading ` ExecuteAdlCache memory cache;` to memory

```solidity
uint256 startGas = gasleft();
ExecuteAdlCache memory cache; 
 cache.startingGas = startGas ;
```
