# `uiFeeReceiver` is counted in each swap, so the front-end may intentionally extend `swapPathMarkets` to get more fee

## Summary

UI fee is used to pay the fee to the front-end. The current implementation is that each swap in `swapPathMarkets` will be counted as a UI fee, and the front-end may intentionally extend `swapPathMarkets` to get more fees. And even if the content of `swapPathMarkets` is shown to the user, the user may not necessarily recognize it, because it is impossible for the user to know all the markets trading pairs.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: swap/SwapUtils.sol
178     function _swap(SwapParams memory params, _SwapParams memory _params) internal returns (address, uint256) {
--skip--
191         SwapPricingUtils.SwapFees memory fees = SwapPricingUtils.getSwapFees(
192             params.dataStore,
193             _params.market.marketToken,
194             _params.amountIn,
195             params.uiFeeReceiver
196         );
--skip--
207         FeeUtils.incrementClaimableUiFeeAmount(
208             params.dataStore,
209             params.eventEmitter,
210             params.uiFeeReceiver,
211             _params.market.marketToken,
212             _params.tokenIn,
213             fees.uiFeeAmount,
214             Keys.UI_SWAP_FEE
215         );
```

Executing each swap in `swapPathMarkets` will call the `_swap` function, and each call of the `_swap` function will count the UI fee once. So the longer `swapPathMarkets`, the more UI fee. The front-end may intentionally display longer `swapPathMarkets` to the user to get more UI fee.

## Impact

Cause users to pay more UI fee to the front-end

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to only pay the swap ui fee once no matter how long the `swapPathMarkets` is
