# Limit orders can be used to get a free look into the future

## Summary
Fix for "Limit orders can be used to get a free look into the future" is not effective
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/130
the report above details how a malicious user can steadily increase wei in order to delay price execution until it is favorable for him to execute the trade. The watson recommended
> Require a delay between when the order was last increased/submitted, and when an update is allowed, similar to [REQUEST_EXPIRATION_BLOCK_AGE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/ExchangeUtils.sol#L24) for the cancellation of market orders

Although there are multiple ways to fix an issue, the fix implemented by the team is ineffective at mitigating this attack.

```solidity
 if (!minOracleBlockNumbers.areGreaterThanOrEqualTo(latestUpdatedAtBlock)) {
                revert Errors.OracleBlockNumbersAreSmallerThanRequired(minOracleBlockNumbers, latestUpdatedAtBlock);
            }
            return;
```
above we can see the fix proposed by the protocol team. This is insufficient because although this Allows execution of limit, stop-loss orders using prices in the same block the order was updated in, A malicious user can still change the amount by +/- 1 wei, and have the order execution delayed until the next block, at which point they can decided again whether the price and or impact is favorable, and whether to exit.
## Impact
impact remains the same, as the watson stated
> If a user has a pending exit order that was submitted a block N, and the user sees that the price at block N+1 will be more favorable, they can update their exit order, changing the amount by +/- 1 wei, and have the order execution delayed until the next block, at which point they can decided again whether the price and or impact is favorable, and whether to exit. In the sponsor's example, if the order was submitted at block 101, they have until block 105 to decide whether to update their order, since the order execution keeper won't be able to do the execution until block 106. There is a gas cost for doing such updates, but if the position is large enough, or the price is gapping enough, it is worth while to do this, especially if someone comes up with an automated service that does this on your behalf.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend to add fix that is similar in nature to what the orginal watson has suggested 
> Require a delay between when the order was last increased/submitted, and when an update is allowed, similar to [REQUEST_EXPIRATION_BLOCK_AGE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/ExchangeUtils.sol#L24) for the cancellation of market orders
