# Malicious user create `UnsupportedOrderType` leading the Keepers to lose the gas fees

## Summary
[OrderHandler._handleOrderError()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/OrderHandler.sol#L224-L290) is to handle a caught order error

## Vulnerability Detail
in case 
```solidity
errorSelector == Errors.UnsupportedOrderType.selector 
```
it will revert without paying the `ExecutionFee` to the keeper. even if the `UnsupportedOrderType` error is not a keeper mistake in fact it's the user's mistake so as a keeper I should not bear the mistakes of the users
so in this case keeper should get his `payExecutionFee()` above that you should `cancelOrder()` because it will never get executed successfully and to guarantee other keepers will not try to execute the same order (the UnsupportedOrderType) again 

## Impact
The malicious users create only one order which is `UnsupportedOrderType` and Keepers will keep trying to execute the same order multiple times this will lead them to lose the gas fees every time

## Recommendation
You should `cancelOrder()` in case `errorSelector == Errors.UnsupportedOrderType.selector `
