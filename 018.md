# Lack of proper access control in AdlUtils

## Summary

The functions in the AdlUtils library, such as `updateAdlState`, `createAdlOrder`, and `validateAdl`, are missing proper access control mechanisms. As a result, malicious actors can exploit the library, potentially leading to unauthorized actions and manipulation of the contract's state.

## Vulnerability Detail

The AdlUtils library does not implement access control checks for external functions like `updateAdlState`, `createAdlOrder`, and `validateAdl`. These functions can be called by any external actor, potentially allowing them to manipulate the contract's state or execute unauthorized actions.

For example, a malicious actor can call the `createAdlOrder` function and create an order with arbitrary parameters, which may lead to an unauthorized reduction of a position.

## Impact

The lack of access control in the AdlUtils library could lead to unauthorized manipulation of the contract's state and execution of unauthorized actions. This vulnerability could result in potential loss of funds, incorrect position calculations, and a general decrease in contract security.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, implement proper access control mechanisms such as the `onlyOwner` or `onlyAuthorized` modifiers for the relevant functions. These modifiers should restrict access to trusted addresses or contracts, ensuring that only authorized actors can call these functions. Additionally, consider adding event logging for critical function calls to provide better transparency and traceability of contract actions.
