# Token whitelist can cause positions and funds to be stuck

## Summary
Un-whitelisting a token would cause stuck funds

## Vulnerability Detail
To be able to interact with the tokens inside GMX, they first have to be whitelisted

`Collateral tokens need to be whitelisted with a configured TOKEN_TRANSFER_GAS_LIMIT`

if they are not whitelisted, the token transfers will fail

With the current design if any token is un-whitelisted users will be unable to cancelDeposits, cancelOrders, and any action that performs swaps will fail including executeDeposit.  

Therefore if any user creates a deposit and the token is removed from the whitelist, the deposit will not be able to be executed, neither canceled. Other impacts while creating, increasing orders will also be present. Overall it is a bad protocol design that limits almost all the features is a token is in the system and it is taken out of the whitelist causing stuck funds and loss of funds for not being able to execute orders/deposits.


## Impact
If any token is un-whitelisted any position or order that requires a transfer of said token will be frozen locking users funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Whitelisted tokens should be enforced while entering the system. If a token is already inside the system, it should definitely not cause funds to be stuck
