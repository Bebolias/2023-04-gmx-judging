# short side of getReservedUsd does not work for market that has the same collateral token

## Summary
short side of getReservedUsd does not work for market that has the same collateral token

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the case of ETH / USD market with both long and short collateral token as ETH.

the available amount to be reserved (ETH) would CHANGE with the price of ETH.

```solidity
    function getReservedUsd(
        DataStore dataStore,
        Market.Props memory market,
        MarketPrices memory prices,
        bool isLong
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 reservedUsd;
        if (isLong) {
            // for longs calculate the reserved USD based on the open interest and current indexTokenPrice
            // this works well for e.g. an ETH / USD market with long collateral token as WETH
            // the available amount to be reserved would scale with the price of ETH
            // this also works for e.g. a SOL / USD market with long collateral token as WETH
            // if the price of SOL increases more than the price of ETH, additional amounts would be
            // automatically reserved
            uint256 openInterestInTokens = getOpenInterestInTokens(dataStore, market, isLong);
            reservedUsd = openInterestInTokens * prices.indexTokenPrice.max;
        } else {
            // for shorts use the open interest as the reserved USD value
            // this works well for e.g. an ETH / USD market with short collateral token as USDC
            // the available amount to be reserved would not change with the price of ETH
            reservedUsd = getOpenInterest(dataStore, market, isLong);
        }

        return reservedUsd;
    }
```
## Impact
reservedUsd does not work when long and short collateral tokens are the same.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider apply both long and short calculations of reserveUsd with relation to the indexTokenPrice.
