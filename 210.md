# XDZIBEC-Excessive Token Burning Vulnerability

## Summary

There is a bug in the` burn()` function,  is set that the `amount` parameter is not checked to see if it is greater than the balance of the account parameter,this means that a malicious actor could call the `burn()` function with an amount that is greater than the balance of the account and lead to insufficient Validation in `burn()` Function Allows Burning Excessive Tokens

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
 }

    // @dev burn tokens from an account
    // @param account the account to burn tokens for
    // @param amount the amount of tokens to burn
    function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external {
        _burn(account, amount);
    }
}
```
the vulnerability in the `MintableToken` contract, s in the `burn()` function. The function subtracts the `amount` of `tokens` from the balance of the `account` parameter, the `amount` parameter is not `checked` to see if it is greater than the `balance` of the account parameter. this means that a malicious actor could call the `burn()` function with an `amount` that is greater than the balance of the account parameter. this would cause the `function` to fail and the `account` parameter would not be updated.
so it's must update the `burn()` function to include a `require()` statement that checks to see if the amount parameter is less than or equal to the balance of the account parameter. If the amount parameter is greater than the balance of the account parameter, then the `require()` statement will fail and the `burn()` function will not be executed. this prevents malicious actors from burning more `tokens` than they have in their account.

## Impact

-An attacker can exploit this vulnerability could lead to be used to steal tokens from users by burning more tokens than they have in their account.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

-update the `burn()` function to include a `require()` statement.
-add a simple check at the beginning of the `burn()` function to verify that the amount parameter is less than or equal to the balance of the specified account
