# `RoleStore#grantRole` should not grant CONTROLLER role to an EOA

## Summary
From the documentation and GMX Sherlock page, no EOA should be granted a CONTROLLER role, but there is no check for this in the grantRole function

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the grantRole function:
```solidity
function grantRole(address account, bytes32 roleKey) external onlyRoleAdmin {
        //@audit From docs, controller should not be an EOA. 
        _grantRole(account, roleKey);
    }
```
And the _grantRole function:
```solidity
function _grantRole(address account, bytes32 roleKey) internal {
        roles.add(roleKey);
        roleMembers[roleKey].add(account);
        roleCache[account][roleKey] = true;
    }
```
This will allow EOAs to be given the CONTROLLER role which is against the specification written in the documentation.

## Impact
The Controller is a highly privileged role throughout the codebase. When an EOA is given this role, he can perform a lot of malicious acts like manipulating DataStore directly, and withdrawing funds when he didn't make any deposit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider including this check:
```solidity
modifier isContract(address _address){
    uint256 codeSize;
    assembly {
        codeSize := extcodesize(_address)
    }
    return codeSize > 0;
}
...
function grantRole(address account, bytes32 roleKey) external onlyRoleAdmin isContract(account) {
      ...
    }
```
