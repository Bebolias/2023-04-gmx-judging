# Limit orders may not work properly in the block after oracles come back after outages

## Summary

Limit orders may not work properly in the block after oracles come back after outages, because they don't have ascending/descending block information


## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the case where a user has submitted a limit order with a trigger price of X, which gets triggered at block N, which is signed by oracles who chunk it with min block N-1 (primary price) and max block N+1 (secondary price). An alternate oracle behavior could be that the oracles go offline during blocks N-1 and N, but come back at N+1 where the price is currently X+1. 
If there is an oracle outage, resulting in there being fewer than `MIN_ORACLE_SIGNERS` (or zero) oracle signing prices, once the oracles come back, they sign prices for the first block they see, which will be N+1 and price X+1 (primary price). 

The current code rejects oracle prices for limit orders, where the trigger price is less than min oracle price, which is the case described above. In such cases, the limit orders will remain stuck.


## Impact

User's orders and capital will remain stuck, and if the order was submitted in order to top off collateral for a position, the user might end up being liquidated.


## Code Snippet
The primary price will be less than the trigger price, and therefore won't be usable for order execution:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/BaseOrderUtils.sol : BaseOrderUtils.setExactOrderPrice()   #1

242                // for limit increase orders:
243                //      - long: validate primaryPrice < triggerPrice
244                //      - short: validate primaryPrice > triggerPrice
245                // for limit decrease orders:
246                //      - long: validate primaryPrice > triggerPrice
247                //      - short: validate primaryPrice < triggerPrice
248                bool shouldValidateSmallerPrimaryPrice = shouldUseMaxPrice;
249    
250 @>             bool ok = shouldValidateSmallerPrimaryPrice ? primaryPrice <= triggerPrice : primaryPrice >= triggerPrice;
251    
252                if (!ok) {
253 @>                 revert Errors.InvalidLimitOrderPrices(primaryPrice, triggerPrice, shouldValidateSmallerPrimaryPrice);
254:               }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Track oracle block gaps, and allow limit orders to execute if the gap was adjacent to the trigger price being reached
