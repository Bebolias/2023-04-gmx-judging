# Back run any transfer to Bank/Vault used for creating withdrawal or increase orders

## Summary
Attacker can front-run withdrawal creation orders and any increase order type that requires to send an `erc20 token` beforehand to steal the `erc20 token` or `wnt` from previous users that are creating a withdrawal or increase order in 2 transactions.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current design of any function implementing `recordTransferIn` requires a transfer of the underlying token in advance of the main transaction itself

In the implementation of `createWithdrawal` it is required to `recordTransferIn` by calculating the balanceOf the vault itself, it is not triggering a direct transfer.

The right way to createWithdrawal would have a separate smart contract that first transfers the tokens to the vault/bank and then triggers `createWithdrawal`. Though this is the desired outcome, it is not the most likely in a lot of scenarios. In the case that individual users interact with these contracts directly, first they have to send the tokens and then call `createWithdrawal` all in different transactions. Incrementing the balance of the vault/bank:

And then calling `createWithdrawal` separately. Anyone can be listening to the mempool for this transfer to happen to the bank/vault contract and front-run the calling  to `createWithdrawal` without the need of sending `wnt/erc20 token`, because it is already accounted from a previous user, "stealing" his `wnt/erc20 token` sent to the vault.

## Impact
Steal all `wnt/erc20 tokens` that users send to the vault before calling `createWithdrawal` ore `createOrder` by front-running their `createWithdrawal` / `createOrder` call

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Overall the system of recording transfers seems off. By not enforcing the general `safeTransfer` from an ERC20, it increases exponentially the likelihood of `createWithdrawal` in two transactions.

Consider adding support for direct transfers apart from only checking balanceOf() when recording a transfer
